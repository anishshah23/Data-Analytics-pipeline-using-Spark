business,"By Michael Corkery The mood in the courtroom was hopeful when Toys “R” Us filed for bankruptcy last September. The company’s lawyer, in the first hearing, played a clip of the retailer’s famous jingle “I’m a Toys ‘R’ Us Kid” and vowed to restore the company’s place in the hearts of millions of American families. The reality is that Toys “R” Us, which announced on Thursday that it would shutter or sell all of its stores in the United States, never had much chance at a turnaround. For over a decade, Toys “R” Us had been drowning in $5 billion of debt, which its private equity backers had saddled it with. With debt payments siphoning off cash every year, Toys “R” Us could not properly invest in its worn-out suburban stores or outdated website. Sales plummeted, as Amazon captured more children’s desires — and their parents’ wallets — for Star Wars Legos and Paw Patrol recycling trucks. Toys “R” Us is the latest failure of financial engineering, albeit one that could portend a potentially more ominous outlook for private equity in the digital era. Most buyouts tend to work the same way. A private equity firm takes over a troubled company with the goal of sprucing up the strategy, cutting costs and overhauling the business over three or five years. But they often load up a company with debt to pay for the deal, which can prove problematic if the profits do not perk up. In the age of Amazon, that formula can be dangerous. Consumer demands are changing so quickly that heavily indebted companies have trouble reordering their business to adapt and compete with better-funded rivals. [ READ MORE: “It’s kind of a punch in the gut for us to see how much online shopping has affected things.” Customers across the United States told us what Toys “R” Us meant to them. Here’s what they had to say » ] A wave of buyouts has collapsed in recent weeks, felled by digital competition. Struggling in the streaming music age, iHeartMedia, the large radio company saddled with debt since its 2008 buyout, filed for bankruptcy this week. The regional New York grocery chain Tops filed for bankruptcy last month, citing competition from Amazon and the debt burden that its former private equity backers had heaped on it. Other buyouts are looking shaky. The television company Univision, which recently scrapped plans for a public offering, is shaking up its leadership. The parent company of the Winn-Dixie supermarket chain said this week it was seeking to restructure its debt, as it planned to close stores. Not all troubled private equity deals end with a company winding down, as in the case of Toys “R” Us. Retailers like Gymboree and Payless ShoeSource have found second lives after emerging from bankruptcy, often with investments from new private equity or hedge fund owners willing to give the business another try. But the deterioration of Toys “R” Us from a potential turnaround strategy to the end of an iconic brand — in a matter of months — shows just how difficult it can be for private equity to compete in a rapidly evolving industry. In retailing, Amazon is reordering everything on the store shelf. And children’s changing interest in games and toys, which now encompasses high-end electronics, adds to the complexity. The company said on Thursday that it had no other option than to begin winding down about 730 stores around the United States. Toys “R” Us was still looking at the possibility of keeping 200 stores open and combining them with its Canadian operations. But no deal had been struck yet. “This is a profoundly sad day for us,” the Toys “R” Us chief executive, David Brandon, said in a statement, “as well as for the millions of kids and families who we have served for the past 70 years.” The toy business looked a lot simpler in 2005, when the private equity firms Bain Capital and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the real estate firm Vornado Realty Trust acquired the company for $6.6 billion. The investor group figured the toy industry was ripe for consolidation. After the buyout, Toys “R” Us bought the famed toy seller F.A.O. Schwarz as well as the brand and website of KB Toys. The company had become the world’s largest “toy showroom,” its shelves stocked with thousands of different actions figures, video games and other wares from large suppliers like Mattel and Hasbro as well as smaller brands that make stuffed animals and glow-in-the-dark slime. Sales were strong, even after the recession. The company had considered going public, giving its private equity owners a way to cash out. But the company scrapped the offering in 2013, citing unfavorable market conditions. Enter Amazon. In recent years, the company had started to aggressively expand its toy business, creating a comprehensive, online showroom with low prices at the click of a button. Pressed by Amazon, Walmart also pushed hard into toys, dropping its prices to capture more market share. Walmart could absorb the price cuts on toys because it makes up the profit on other items. But for Toys “R” Us, a price war on toys and games, its only offerings, was devastating. In 2015, the company hired Mr. Brandon as chief executive. The former head of the University of Michigan’s athletic department, he helped turn around Domino’s Pizza, another private equity investment. But he lacked extensive experience in the toy industry. By the time he joined Toys “R” Us, the company faced a conundrum. After a lack of investment, its stores were in need of a serious overhaul. Many American customers complained about its sprawling spaces and tired displays. But it was unclear whether those investments would pay off when parents were shopping increasingly on their laptops and smartphones. Money, too, was tight. Most of its debt, totaling about $5 billion, had not been paid down since the buyout 12 years earlier. It was paying $400 million in interest payments each year. “This company had a long history of taking on debt and kicking the can down the road for 10 years, and refinancing,” said Douglas M. Foley, a lawyer at McGuireWoods, who is representing a lender in the Toys “R” Us bankruptcy. With sales falling and debt payments mounting, the company’s lawyer said in September that Toys “R” Us had “too much debt.” It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, seeking to shed some of its debt and reorganize its business. The company secured new loans to keep operating into the critical holiday selling season and said it would hire hundreds of seasonal workers to help improve customer service. But the holidays were a bust for Toys “R” Us, even as other retailers reported strong sales. On Thursday, the company said that its earnings during the shopping season were $250 million less than expected. The lenders, which had given the company considerable leeway during the holidays, lost confidence in the turnaround plan. “The business plan was underwhelming, that is best way to say it,” Mr. Foley said. The company has been hemorrhaging money. Mr. Foley calculated that the company had spent nearly $50 million on legal, banking and consulting fees from September through January. The lenders determined that they needed to stop burning through cash and start selling off the company’s inventory and real estate. The company said on Thursday that it talked to several possible buyers of its American operations. But it could not complete a sale, leading to its demise. “The retail industry is going through such a convulsion, it is not clear what the end of the road looks like,” said Stephen B. Selbst, a bankruptcy lawyer at Herrick Feinstein. “If you are an equity investor, you probably think ‘you know what? I have other uses for my money.”    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
business,"By Tara Siegel Bernard Bitcoin may grab headlines when it skyrockets in value, as it did much of last year, or when it plunges precipitously, as it has this week. But the virtual currency has a reputation for providing a sense of anonymity to those who own it. That anonymity doesn’t extend to the tax authorities, however. Come April, people who have bought and sold Bitcoin — or any of the other digital currencies that have quickly sprouted across the web — will be expected to report any profits on their federal tax returns. Considering Bitcoin’s jump of more than 1,500 percent last year, there are probably many people who logged gains or losses for the first time, as people rushed in with the irrational exuberance of the early dot-com days. But how much tax you owe will depend on how and when you acquired the digital currency — which, in fact, isn’t treated as a currency at all. Instead, for tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service views Bitcoin and its cryptocoin cousins as property. For the most part, that means Bitcoin and other digital currencies will be treated similarly to an investment like stocks — but not always. Given the speed at which these currencies have caught on — Bitcoin was released only in 2009 — regulators haven’t quite kept pace. The I.R.S. issued basic guidelines in 2014 for digital currencies, but tax experts say some of the rules are subject to interpretation. Other aspects, however, are quite clear. “Every time you transfer a cryptocurrency, you might trigger a gain and pay a tax,” said Selva Ozelli, a tax lawyer and accountant who has recently written about the tax implications of virtual currencies. In late 2016, the I.R.S. made it clear that it was searching for cryptocurrency tax evaders: The agency sent a broad request to Coinbase, the largest Bitcoin exchange in the United States, requesting records for all customers who bought digital currency from the company from 2013 to 2015. Coinbase balked, but a court ruled that it must provide the records of roughly 14,000 customers, fewer than 1 percent of its patrons, who made transactions involving more than $20,000 of virtual currencies. “If you play audit roulette, you are a fool,” said Daniel Morris, an accountant with expertise in digital currencies. “If you made a single trade or more, report it.” Here are some basics about the tax implications of virtual currency: I sold some Bitcoin last year. What do I need to do? If you are holding Bitcoin as an investment, any gains or losses on the sale are treated as capital assets, like a stock or bond. The gain or loss is calculated against the market value of the currency when you acquired it (known as your basis). If you held the currency for more than a year, you qualify for the less onerous long-term capital gains rates (generally 0, 15 or 20 percent). Short-term gains, from digital coins held for a year or less, are taxed as ordinary income. As on the stock market, losses can be used to offset capital gains, subject to certain rules, and losses that are not used to offset gains can be deducted — up to $3,000 — from other kinds of income. Unused losses can be carried over to future years. I bought a computer (or another product or service) using Bitcoin. Are there tax implications? The short answer: Yes. More than 100,000 merchants worldwide accept Bitcoin, including big companies like Microsoft and Expedia, according to a 2017 report from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting, a tax software and analysis firm. So, for instance, if you bought Bitcoin as an investment in  late 2013, when it was trading at around $1,000, and used it to buy a car when the currency was trading at $18,000, you would have a long-term capital gain of $17,000, explained Ryan Losi, an accountant and executive vice president at Piascik, a tax firm. Likewise, if you suffer a loss, that should also be reported on your tax return. I’ve successfully ‘mined’ Bitcoins. Now what? All Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public ledger maintained by a decentralized network of computers. Mining refers to the process in which new Bitcoins are created and then awarded to the computers that are the first to process these transactions coming onto the network. The people whose computers do this most quickly collect a fresh helping of Bitcoins. These virtual miners must report the fair market value of the currency (on the day they received it) as gross income. Miners are also required to pay self-employment tax — that is, Social Security and Medicare taxes — if the mining “constitutes a trade or business,” according to the I.R.S. I was paid in Bitcoin. Are there any special tax consequences? Receiving wages from an employer in a virtual currency is like being paid in dollars: It is taxable to the employee, must be reported by the employer on a Form W-2 and is subject to federal income tax withholding, according to Wolters Kluwer. Independent contractors paid in digital currency must also treat that as gross income and pay self-employment taxes. What if I paid someone else in Bitcoin for their services? When you pay an independent worker (not on your payroll) in excess of $600 for services performed for your “trade or business,” that should be reported to the I.R.S. and the person receiving the payment (generally using Form 1099-MISC). The same rules apply when an individual is paid in virtual currency with an equivalent value. Can I reduce my tax bill by donating my cryptocoins? Potentially. Only people who itemize their tax returns can deduct their charitable contributions. But under the new tax code, far fewer people are likely to itemize starting with their 2018 return. For those who still itemize, it may be possible to directly donate their Bitcoin (or Ether, etc.), just as they can directly donate, say, highly appreciated stock — as long as the charity accepts it. For example, Fidelity Charitable, a donor-advised fund, allows people to give money, take a tax deduction in the same year, and then invest and allocate the money to select charities over time. Fidelity Charitable collected roughly $22 million in Bitcoin donations through early December; it works with Coinbase, the exchange, to immediately turn the Bitcoin or Ether into cash, which is then invested as its donor wishes. Will I receive any tax forms from my exchange? Do I have to track my own transactions? Generally speaking, brokers and exchanges are not yet required to report cryptocurrency transactions to the I.R.S., as they do when you sell a stock at a profit or loss (and you receive a 1099-B or a 1099-DIV for a mutual fund). But you will need to keep track of every move you make. Coinbase, for example, refers you to your account transaction history for records to compute your gains and losses; it also provides customers a “cost basis for taxes” report. One of the most common questions TurboTax received from its users was how and where to report their virtual currency transactions, according to Lisa Greene-Lewis, an accountant with TurboTax. (Use Form 8949 to add it all up, and report it on Schedule D, along with any other capital gains.) Does the new tax bill change any of this? The bill eliminated what some interpreted to be a tax break for virtual currency holders. Under the old rules, some cryptocoin investors applied a legal maneuver often used with real estate investments to defer their capital gains. Under what is called a 1031 exchange, taxpayers can sell one property and defer taxes as long as the proceeds were reinvested in a similar, or “like-kind,” property and met certain requirements. The I.R.S. didn’t say this strategy could be used with virtual currencies, but some tax experts argued that it was a reasonable — albeit debatable — interpretation since the coins were considered property. Now that the tax legislation limits the use of 1031 exchanges to real estate, they no longer apply, accountants said. So … should I finally buy Bitcoin? Carl Richards, a certified financial planner, recently suggested asking yourself a different question: Does Bitcoin fit into my investment plan? Warren E. Buffett said he believed the cryptocurrency story would end badly, while Abigail Johnson, chief executive officer of Fidelity, called herself a believer. Whatever you decide, never gamble more than what you can afford to lose — and you’ll need to report it.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "

MAY 3, 2018
 In 2016, a mysterious syndicate tried to steal $951 million from Bangladesh’s central bank - and laid bare a profound weakness in the system by which money moves around the world. At 8:45 in the morning on Friday, Feb. 5, 2016, Zubair Bin Huda, a director at Bangladesh’s central bank, entered the 30-story, concrete-and-glass headquarters in Dhaka. Bin Huda, slim and soft-spoken, with a thin black mustache and beard, rode an elevator to the ninth floor and eventually walked into the back office of the Accounts and Budgeting Department’s “dealing room,” the most restricted area of the building, accessible to only a handful of employees. Until about a decade ago, Bangladesh’s central bank was stuck in the analog age: Staff members sent international payment instructions via a teleprinter, an electromechanical typewriter that sent and received messages over standard phone lines and other channels. But since a new bank governor took over in 2009, the institution had gone digital. Its international transfer orders are now dispatched via Swift, the Brussels-based electronic network used by 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories. Inside a 12-foot-by-8-foot glass-walled chamber, under the scrutiny of closed-circuit security cameras, staff members log into Swift and dispatch the payment orders with encrypted communications. With a few keystrokes, a complex process is set in motion that sends millions of dollars zipping across continents. Bin Huda was the duty manager that morning, which meant he was tasked with scrutinizing printouts of transfer confirmations, routine queries and other Swift messages that had come in overnight. Friday is a bank holiday in Bangladesh, but a dedicated printer still generated hard copies of digital transfer messages. A few dozen would usually come in over the course of a day, but that morning Bin Huda didn’t see any on the printer. He assumed it was a technical glitch and decided to deal with it on Saturday. At 9 o’clock the next morning, he returned to the office. This time, he found that the Swift software — the program that launches the messaging service — wasn’t functioning, either. Each time he tried to open it, a disconcerting error message appeared: A file is missing or changed. He and his colleagues huddled over the dedicated Swift computer, following directions on the monitor on how to get the software running again. Shortly after noon, he was able to retrieve three messages from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and to print them out one by one. The New York Fed is, in effect, the gatekeeper of much of world banking, and hosts accounts for 250 central banks and governments with deposits of about $3 trillion. A Fed employee had written to Bangladesh, asking for clarification about 46 payment instructions received over the past 24 hours. The Fed had never seen orders like that or a total so large from the bank — nearly $1 billion.   It had to be a mistake, Bin Huda thought. Bangladesh Bank, as the central bank is known, never sent payment instructions on weekends, and even during business hours, it rarely sent more than two or three to the Fed in a day. He scrolled through the message file in search of more information. Where was the money headed? The one debit statement he could find was corrupted and unreadable. Desperate to stop the transactions from moving forward, but unsure where to turn, Bin Huda emailed a Swift case manager at the organization’s Brussels headquarters. He told bank officials that he had reported a “big accident” in the Swift system. He tried to reach the Fed in New York by telephone, but the bank was shut down for the weekend. Bin Huda emailed and faxed a demand to the Fed to stop processing all payments, including all those mentioned in the queries. Hoping that someone would get the message, Bin Huda then shut down his computer and went home to enjoy his weekend with his family. Although no one knew this yet, Bin Huda was in the middle of the most daring bank robbery ever attempted using Swift. And it would prove to be the most severe breach yet of a system designed to be unbreachable. Swift’s transmission process — by which money moves through the dispatching of encrypted messages to multiple operating centers and then on to the receivers — has become the standard in the banking world, flawlessly processing more than three billion payment orders a year. It uses “military grade” security systems, says Adrian Nish, the head of Threat Intelligence for BAE Systems, a cybersecurity firm in Britain that investigated the attack on Bangladesh Bank. Swift (the acronym stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a cooperative founded in 1973 and owned by its member banks) recommends that its institutions use multifactor authentication to log on and that they segregate the Swift server from the rest of their internal network. Even for skilled and dedicated hackers, the most viable path to penetrating Swift runs through the member banks, which operate the software that lets them log into the Swift system — providing “the technical handshake that opens the secure pipe,” as one cybersecurity expert put it to me. During the past three years, a rash of smaller incidents have shown the vulnerabilities in the system, as cyberthieves broke into the computer networks of banks in Ecuador, Taiwan, Vietnam, Poland, India and Russia to send out phony payment instructions via the Swift network. Alert bank officials were able to call back some fake payments, but millions of dollars were lost. “A lot of institutions in emerging markets don’t have the same security controls that more mature banks have,” says Patrick Neighorn of FireEye, a U.S. cybersecurity firm. “In some the passwords aren’t centrally managed, or they didn’t know what all the devices connecting their network are.” The Bangladesh job, though, was an order of magnitude more sophisticated. The hackers’ approach was masterly in its foresight and complexity, and the malware they used, or variations of it, later turned up in several of the other bank breaches. The intruders most likely entered the bank’s computer network through a single vulnerable terminal, using a contaminated website or email attachment, and planted malware that gave them total control, even a view of the screens they were manipulating. There, hiding in plain sight, they waited for months to gain an understanding of the bank’s business operations. They harvested employee passwords and worked their way to the most tightly guarded corner of the network: the Swift server. Despite Swift’s warnings, the bank had not segregated its Swift server from the rest of the computer network. “It takes a huge amount of skill to understand the target systems and to be able to subvert them the way they did,” says Nish of BAE Systems. In contrast to off-the-shelf tools that have been used in many recent attacks — such as the “SQL injection code” deployed in 2015 to break into the database of TalkTalk, a British telecommunications firm, and access the bank information and personal details of more than 20,000 subscribers — the malware that the thieves devised was “a custom code, built for attacks on banks and configured for a specific bank,” Nish says. And because it was written from scratch, it was unfamiliar to existing virus-protection programs. After the hackers sent their counterfeit payment orders via the secure Swift messaging network, they completely erased their footprints by deleting those orders from the bank’s Swift database, wiping out the evidence from the printer statements and updating the balances in the bank’s New York Fed account to make it appear that no money had been debited. In effect, Nish says, “the thieves figured out how to make themselves disappear.” The hackers also succeeded in turning one of Swift’s defining features — its global reach — into a vulnerability. After months of lurking in the system, they planned their attack for a moment when the banks were unable to communicate effectively. Beginning on Thursday afternoon, New York time, when the Fed had received a total of 70 fraudulent payment orders to four bank accounts in the Philippines and one in Sri Lanka, totaling $1 billion, Bangladesh Bank was closed for the weekend. On Sunday, when the bank reopened and discovered the error, it was unable to reach the Fed. Bin Huda sent a stop-payment order to the Philippines central bank, which was closed for the Chinese New Year. “There was no hotline between the Bangladesh Bank and the Fed in New York,” says Atiur Rahman, the governor of Bangladesh Bank at the time of the heist. “Essentially, I think this was a flaw of the global payment system.” Late on Monday afternoon, Dhaka time, as the Fed was opening for business, Bangladesh Bank asked officials in New York to block the money transfer to the Philippines but were told it was too late and that the money was with recipient banks. On Tuesday morning, more than four days after the theft, Rahman finally reached his Philippine counterpart via a landline from his office and begged him to intervene. The Philippine bank governor asked him to file a written complaint, a Bangladesh Bank official says, and to send it through the diplomatic pouch. Rahman says he was told to keep the matter quiet until it was fully clear what happened. In early March, according to a bank official, an elite police unit was given permission to inspect the back office. Investigators seized passports to see if anyone had traveled to the Philippines, slapped one employee with a travel ban and questioned the others for hours. Rahman resigned a few days later. Ultimately, it was only a few strokes of good luck that kept the heist from being far worse. On Thursday, Feb. 4 — the day before Bin Huda noticed that the Swift software had crashed — five payment orders went through without triggering an alarm: a $20 million deposit for the Shalika Foundation, an agricultural NGO in Sri Lanka that had an account at Pan Asia Bank, and four for individual accounts at the Jupiter branch of Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation near Manila. They didn’t clear instantaneously: Fedwire, a Fed-run service for 5,300 clients, enables participants to transfer cash to one another in seconds, but neither of those banks was a member of Fedwire. So the Fed instead began steering the payments to several “correspondent banks” — typically, large commercial institutions that serve as intermediaries between the Fed and smaller banks that aren’t part of its network. In this case, Deutsche Bank had a financial relationship with the bank in Sri Lanka; and the Bank of New York Mellon, Citibank and Wells Fargo dealt regularly with R.C.B.C. When these banks’ automated systems also failed to pick up anything suspicious, the orders were processed. But the next 30 payment orders, totaling $850 million, were held up by a fortunate coincidence. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, says that the automated system flagged the word “Jupiter,” the name of the R.C.B.C. bank branch to which the Swift order was addressed, because it happened to match the name of a totally different business on a sanctions list: Jupiter Seaways Shipping, an Athens-based firm that was blackballed for evading sanctions against Iran. When Fed compliance officers took a close look at the orders, other irregularities became apparent. According to the former Philippine senator Sergio Osmeña III, who later examined the transactions as part of his nation’s investigation into the heist, the payments bore the addresses of the same four account holders in the R.C.B.C. Jupiter branch. “If it hadn’t been for the quick action of someone at the central bank in New York, an additional $900 million would have been lost,” Maloney says.   Then one of the first five transactions — those that had initially cleared — ran aground, too. An alert clerk at the small bank in Sri Lanka noticed something that the global players had not: The payment was unusually large for such a small NGO. The clerk held the $20 million order and went to Deutsche Bank for clarification. Deutsche Bank took a closer look and discovered that the word “Foundation” had been misspelled. Suspicious, Deutsche Bank contacted Bangladesh Bank, which sent a stop-payment order. This left four payments, totaling $81 million, that went through — an enormous bank job by any metric (by contrast, the most recent large-scale cyberheist, when hackers hit India’s City Union Bank in February 2018, reaped about $1.5 million) and an enormous blow to the global financial system. “What struck me the most was that this action struck at trust in the international banking system,” Representative Maloney says. “And if you can’t trust international banking, then international commerce could grind to a halt.” Yet when it came to the Bangladesh heist, transferring the cash was only the first part of the scheme. It was one thing to use malicious software to tunnel into the bank’s Swift network and send out dozens of phony transfer orders to banks around the world. It was quite another to turn that digital cash into real money and then make it disappear. Philippine authorities have focused on Maia Santos-Deguito, a career banker in her early 40s, as the linchpin of the heist’s second phase. At the time of the transfers, she was working as the manager of the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation’s Jupiter branch. Santos-Deguito worked at several smaller banks before earning her prized position at R.C.B.C., a branch that primarily serves the residents of Bel-Air Village, an affluent neighborhood of tree-shaded residential streets and busy commercial boulevards lined with yoga salons, boutiques and expensive cafes. In May 2015, nine months before Bin Huda of Bangladesh Bank was baffled by the Swift breakdown, Santos-Deguito met with a longtime client, Kam Sin (Kim) Wong, according to her lawyer. A Hong Kong-born restaurateur and president of Eastern Hawaii Leisure Company, Wong ran “casino junkets” in Manila and northern Luzon, bringing in Chinese high rollers on charter flights, operating V.I.P. rooms in casinos, providing them chips on credit and then taking a cut of the house profit. Wong had experience moving money in and out of an industry where it was nearly impossible to keep track of it. The U.S. State Department’s 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report described the Philippines as a “major” money-laundering site, noting that “criminal groups use the Philippine banking system, commercial enterprises and particularly casinos to transfer drug and other illicit proceeds from the Philippines to offshore accounts.” In 2001, the Philippines passed an Anti-Money Laundering Act, and by 2016 the Legislature had amended it three times to evade a blacklist designation by the Financial Action Task Force, an international watchdog. But Juan Ponce Enrile, a powerful ex-secretary of national defense, used his position as Senate president to persuade his colleagues to shield casinos from the law — keeping their operations secret and their customers anonymous. In the mid-1990s, Enrile started the Cagayan Economic Zone, a free port near northern Luzon that has attracted casinos and reportedly become a money-laundering hub. The secrecy seems to have been very good for business. In 2016 Bloomberry Resorts, one of the region’s biggest casino operators, posted a net income of $46 million. Melco Crown Philippines Resorts, the operator of City of Dreams Manila, another major gambling resort, had the best-performing casino stock in the world in 2017. “There are no controls, none whatsoever,” Osmeña told me. According to Santos-Deguito’s attorney, Wong introduced her to a few Filipino associates and asked her to open accounts for them at the Jupiter branch. R.C.B.C. colleagues claimed at a Senate hearing that these “clients” never existed, and they accused Santos-Deguito of using forged signatures and a driver’s-license photo from a former colleague to manufacture their identities. Santos-Deguito’s attorney maintains that his client is innocent and says that she trusted Wong. The prospect of lining up wealthy new clients was enticing for her. It was a potential win for her employer, R.C.B.C., as well. Santos-Deguito kept the accounts open — and nearly empty — for eight months. Then on Friday morning, Feb. 5, 2016, they suddenly became active. That morning, R.C.B.C. headquarters received Swift instructions from its correspondent banks in the United States to transfer the $81 million into the accounts. Santos-Deguito had already vouched for the integrity of her clients, and she again confirmed that they were legitimate. A colleague at the Jupiter branch testified at the Senate hearings that, on the same day the cash arrived, he watched Santos-Deguito stuff $400,000 into a paper bag and carry it to her car. A three-day weekend, including the Chinese New Year, followed. Then on the morning of Tuesday, Feb. 9, Santos-Deguito arrived at her storefront branch office in Bel-Air Village and began moving the $81 million out of the accounts. By that point, at the R.C.B.C. headquarters in downtown Manila, employees in the payments department were working through a backlog of nearly 800 Swift messages that had accumulated during the holiday weekend. Among them was a stop-payment order marked “urgent” from Bangladesh Bank. The message went unread until 11 a.m. — by which time Santos-Deguito was in the midst of transferring the $81 million into a fifth account, and from there to a remittance firm called PhilRem, owned by a married couple, Michael and Salud Bautista. Santos-Deguito, who claims she was just following her clients’ orders, finished transferring the funds by 11:30 a.m. The Bautistas converted at least $61 million into Philippine pesos — more than three billion of them. Around 7:30 that evening, a courier from PhilRem testified, he picked up a suitcase, a traveling bag and a shoulder bag at the company’s office. The luggage was stuffed with 90 million pesos, worth $1.8 million, and $500,000 in U.S. cash. The courier placed the cash into the back of a van, and with a company driver, his uncle, at the wheel, set out for the Bloomberry-owned Solaire Resort and Casino. There, at the lobby entrance, the pair dragged out the luggage and placed it onto a casino trolley. The courier wheeled the money across the lobby, past rows of digital slot machines and a section of tables for Sabong, a card game based on Philippine-style cock fighting. He took an elevator at the far end of the lobby to the second floor V.I.P. room, where, he testified, Kim Wong, Salud Bautista and one of Wong’s associates were waiting.   The Bautistas claimed in Senate testimony that this delivery was the first of many that his firm would make: It delivered $30 million in cash to Wong’s associate and wired $29 million to the Solaire Casino and another $21 million to Wong’s company, Eastern Hawaii. (Through their lawyers, Wong and the Bautistas declined to comment; they have maintained their innocence.) In his Senate testimony, Wong claimed that he received only $13.5 million and that the Bautistas pocketed the rest. Two of Wong’s fellow gambling promoters, Gao Shuhua and Ding Zhize, also received large amounts of cash. In the V.I.P. room at Solaire, a plush lounge with butterscotch carpets, brass chandeliers and about a dozen round baccarat tables, junket players crowded around in a haze of cigarette smoke, drinking Chinese tea and fruit juice while placing their bets. The minimum bet at the table was 10,000 Philippine pesos, or roughly $200 in U.S. cash, and millions of pesos could move into the house or into the player’s pockets in a single evening. At the end of each night, during a spree that seems to have lasted a week or more, the gamblers turned their chips back into untraceable cash. Their names remained unregistered, their winnings unreported: It was, Philippine officials say, the ultimate money-laundering operation. “All we know is that the cash was delivered to certain gamblers at the casinos,” Osmeña says, “and then, after that, the gamblers weren’t here anymore, and the money was gone.” Who had the expertise and the audacity to carry out such a heist? Weeks after the crime, Bangladesh Bank hired FireEye, the U.S. cybersecurity firm, to investigate. FireEye signed a nondisclosure agreement with the bank and has declined to discuss specifics, but some of the bank’s findings have leaked out, and other cybersecurity firms have drawn their own conclusions from publicly available evidence. The analysts compared some of the tools used with those employed in two other notorious cyberattacks: the November 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, when a group calling itself the Guardians of Peace released embarrassing emails and salaries and wiped out many of Sony’s servers; and “Dark Seoul,” a March 2013 hack that disabled internet servers at three South Korean banks and froze computers at two South Korean broadcasters. (The base code, Nish says, was also the same one used in the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, in which hackers paralyzed more than 200,000 computers around the world and demanded Bitcoin payments to unfreeze them.) All these operations, the experts concluded, bore the markings of what the security firms called the Lazarus Group — a shadowy organization that U.S. intelligence experts say is most likely affiliated with North Korea. Harsh economic sanctions have left the dictatorship struggling with nationwide food shortages and inching ever closer to a nuclear confrontation. At an Aspen Institute panel last March, the National Security Agency deputy director Richard Ledgett mentioned the findings of the cybersecurity firms and said that they could indicate a new level of North Korean criminality. “If that linkage is true, that means a nation-state is robbing banks,” he said. “That’s a big deal; it’s different.” The New York Times has reported that North Korea is believed to maintain a network of about 1,700 computer hackers around the world, aided by 5,000 trainers, supervisors and other support staff. Many operations are aimed at harvesting intelligence from South Korea; others, as in the case of Sony, are intended to avenge slights, or others to reap financial gain. North Korean hackers have become especially adept at targeting the weak links in the financial system: banks in developing nations, especially those in Southeast Asia. “They are easy prey,” says Vitaly Kamluk of Kaspersky Lab, which found Korean-language coding embedded in some Lazarus Group malware and claims it definitively linked the Lazarus Group to North Korea, through an I.P. address that the group briefly used during a wave of attacks in Europe and Central America in 2017. “These central banks often cannot afford good security, good software, or hire a proper specialist to configure their network,” Kamluk says. “They are low-hanging fruit.” Although gambling is strictly prohibited inside the country, North Korean leadership has a well-documented interest in the casino industry. The country has been suspected of running online casinos and, according to news reports, has been seeking $20 million from foreign investors to launch a luxury liner and casino that would cruise to Vladivostok and ports in Southeast Asia. Since the heist, Philippine authorities have managed to recover about one-fifth of the missing money for Bangladesh Bank. Wong turned over $15 million, and the Bautistas, suspected by the Senate of walking away with $17 million but still denying wrongdoing, offered to pay $200,000, but the Bangladeshis rejected the money. The rest is probably gone for good. Gone, too, are the shadowy casino-junket operators from mainland China, Ding and Gao, who in February apparently boarded charter flights from Manila to Macau. A former Portuguese colony, Macau has long been an important financial conduit between North Korea and the outside world. Bangladesh Bank is still trying to recoup as much as it can. In February, its deputy governor announced that the bank was filing a lawsuit against R.C.B.C., charging that its employees had doubts about the Swift payment instructions but executed the orders anyway. R.C.B.C., which has been fined a record $1 billion pesos by the Philippine central bank over the incident, threatened a countersuit against Bangladesh Bank for defamation. One bank that did authorize the payments, Wells Fargo, just reached an out-of-court settlement with Ecuador’s Banco del Austro, which had filed a lawsuit seeking to hold the bank responsible for approving the transfer of $12 million from its account in a 2015 cyberheist. The undisclosed settlement could give a boost to Bangladesh Bank’s attempts to recover its losses. In the United States, thanks to Representative Maloney’s prodding, the Fed has instituted a 24/7 hotline to deal with such emergencies. And in the Philippines, the Senate hearings about the crime prompted Congress to impose the first set of transparency rules on the casinos, requiring that every bet over five million pesos, or $100,000, be reported to the Anti-Money Laundering Council. But there was no indication, Osmeña told me, “that anything had changed.” Indeed, Gabriel Lingan, the head of marketing and business development at the Cagayan Economic Zone Authority, which oversees the Eastern Hawaii Casino and Resort in Santa Ana, said that nearly a year after the law was passed, the exact policies regarding when and how casinos will file reports were still being negotiated. “We are still working on the details,” he said. Of the many people believed to be involved in the Bangladesh Bank heist, only one faces charges: Maia Santos-Deguito, who was indicted on multiple counts of money laundering and faces a possible 14-year prison term. Kim Wong, the Bautistas and others suspected of helping Santos-Deguito have all walked away. “Santos-Deguito was guilty, and PhilRem was guilty, and to a certain extent Kim Wong was guilty,” Osmeña said one day at his home as servants prepared lunch in his palm-filled garden. “The Department of Justice is very crooked, very crooked, and you would do us a favor if you would point that out,” he went on. “It’s a joke, I’m frustrated by it all, but what can I do?” Officials assume that once the junketeers stepped off the plane in Macau, it would have been easy for them to send the money, via wire or courier, to Pyongyang. But the junket operators’ precise ties to North Korea — or the exact route taken by the cash from Macau — remain a mystery. “We never got to find out who was really behind it,” Osmeña told me, shaking his head in frustration. “And what the ultimate destination is, we don’t know.” An earlier version of this article misstated an area that was affected by cyberattacks in 2017 that Kaspersky Lab claims were linked to North Korea. In addition to Europe, the attacks occurred in Central America, not the United States. Julfikar Ali Manik contributed reporting from Dhaka, Bangladesh.

business,"By Reuters SEOUL/SINGAPORE — Investors in global chipmakers have had a rocky ride in the last few months on worries about a slowing smartphone market, but a clamor for more video content from consumers is underpinning buoyant sales for memory-chip makers. Indeed, the earnings reports of various chipmakers and smartphone companies in the past month tell a more interesting story beyond the cooling in phone shipment volumes: smartphone makers are cramming their devices with memory to satisfy the increasing demands of consumers.  A case in point is last week's quarterly report from Apple Inc. The Cupertino, California-based company said the iPhone X was the most popular iPhone model in the March quarter - the first cycle ever where the costliest iPhone was also the most sought after.  More upbeat assessments from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Qualcomm Inc , and Franco-Italian company STMicroelectronics, have also eased concerns. Samsung last month forecast strong sales for ""high-density"" chips that have more processing power and bigger storage capacity - demand that will help it weather a decline in overall smartphone shipments as consumers are willing to pay for costlier and faster models that allow them to easily watch and store large amounts of video. ""Even as the number of smartphone shipments slow down, each smartphone will contain memory chips with bigger capacity and better performance, which, for memory chip makers, makes up for a slowdown in the number of total smartphones,"" said Kim Rok-ho, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment. That puts into perspective a warning by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) of softer smartphone sales, which was partly responsible for the recent selloff in Apple and other chipmakers. The broader concerns about a slowdown in the chip market appear to have eased as well.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, a proxy for global chipmakers that fell sharply from its peak in mid-March on initial iPhone sales concerns, has stabilized in the past two weeks, posting a 4.4 percent rise so far this year. PURE-PLAY MEMORY  The $122 billion memory chip industry enjoyed an unprecedented boom since mid-2016, expanding nearly 70 percent in 2017 alone, thanks to robust growth of smartphones and cloud services that require more powerful chips that can store loads of data.  The pace of growth is set to more than halve as memory-chip prices come off their highs, but the outlook remains strong for pure-play memory chipmakers such as Micron Technology Inc and SK Hynix. Micron's shares have risen 18 percent this year and Hynix's stock has gained 8.5 percent.  Revenue at Micron, for instance, has grown at an average rate of about 65 percent in the two quarters it has reported this year, and analysts expect it to grow at an average of 30 percent for the rest of the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Micron and Hynix both trade at roughly 4 times forward 12-month earnings against a sector median of 16.7, suggesting that the stocks have room to grow.  Other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Texas Instruments, which are less leveraged to the smartphone market, including those that sell to carmakers, industrial, bitcoin, and gaming companies are well set up too. PROCESSOR CHIPS VULNERABLE All the same, the slowdown in smartphone shipments is bad news for chipmakers that design microprocessors: each phone needs just one microprocessor chip versus rapid growth of memory content in devices.  Global smartphone shipments fell 2 percent in the first quarter, following a 9 percent drop in the fourth quarter, according to market research firm StrategyAnalytics. Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon processors power many popular smartphone models, recently showed just how far it is willing to go to hedge against a slowdown after revenue from its key licensing business slumped 44 percent in the latest quarter. The company, which charges a fee for its chip patents based on a percentage of the selling price of a smartphone, said it would cap the phone price used to calculate that fee at $400. More expensive phones, which can sell for $1,000, would still be treated as $400 for the purpose of the Qualcomm license fee.  TSMC, whose fortunes are more closely tied with the broader smartphone industry as it is the world's largest contract chipmaker, felt the slowdown more acutely in the latest quarter. Qualcomm and TSMC stocks are down 21 percent and 2.6 percent respectively so far this year.  ""The spending cycle (by chipmakers for investment) is continuing, but there may still be volatility similar to the correction in 2015,"" Tammy Qiu, an analyst at Berenberg said in a note to clients.

business,"Advertisement By NELLIE BOWLESJAN. 13, 2018
 SAN FRANCISCO — Recently the founder of something called Ripple briefly became richer than Mark Zuckerberg. Another day an anonymous donor set up an $86 million Bitcoin-fortune charity called the Pineapple Fund. A Tesla was spotted with a BLOCKHN license plate. There’s a surge in people looking to buy Bitcoin on their credit cards. After the Long Island Iced Tea company announced it would pivot to blockchain, its stock rose 500 percent in a day. In 2017, the cryptocurrency Bitcoin went from $830 to $19,300, and now quivers around $14,000. Ether, its main rival, started the year at less than $10, closing out 2017 at $715. Now it’s over $1,100. The wealth is intoxicating news, feverish because it seems so random. Investors trying to grok the landscape compare it to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when valuations soared and it was hard to separate the Amazons and Googles from the Pets.coms and eToys. The cryptocurrency community is centered around a tightknit group of friends — developers, libertarians, Redditors and cypherpunks — who have known each other for years through meet-ups, an endless circuit of crypto conferences and internet message boards. Over long hours in anonymous group chats, San Francisco bars and Settlers of Catan game nights, they talk about how cryptocurrency will decentralize power and wealth, changing the world order. The goal may be decentralization, but the money is extremely concentrated. Coinbase has more than 13 million accounts that own cryptocurrencies. Data suggests that about 94 percent of the Bitcoin wealth is held by men, and some estimate that 95 percent of the wealth is held by 4 percent of the owners. Advertisement There are only a few winners here, and, unless they lose it all, their impact going forward will be outsize. Advertisement They also remember who laughed at them and when. James Spediacci and his twin brother, Julian, who bought ether when it was about 30 cents, now run one of the most popular whale clubs: private cryptocurrency trading communities where crypto syndicates are coordinated in group chats. He showed me a screen shot of his Facebook post from 2014 telling everyone to buy ether. “One like,” he said, pointing to his phone. “It got one like.” Whether it’s all built on sand or not, the crypto castle has risen. There’s an actual house called the Crypto Castle, and the king is Jeremy Gardner, 25, a rakish young investor with a hedge fund who has become the de facto tour guide for crypto newcomers. Early one afternoon, he opened a bottle of rosé while he charged half a dozen external batteries so he wouldn’t have to ever plug in his phone in Ibiza, Spain, the next week. “I do I.C.O.s. It’s my thing,” he said. He wore a pink button-front and pink pants. “It’s me, a couple V.C.s and a lot of charlatans.” An initial coin offering is a way to raise money: A company creates its own cryptocurrency and investors buy into the new coin, without actually buying a stake in the company. Mr. Gardner led an I.C.O. for his start-up Augur, creating an “Augur token” that he then sold to raise real world money. These tokens sold fast, and it is one of the forces that kicked off this boom. For a time, the value of Augur, a market-forecasting start-up with few customers, exceeded $1 billion. About eight people live in the Crypto Castle on any given night, and some of Mr. Gardner’s tenants brought out snacks (Cheez-Its and a jar of Nutella). One of the bedrooms has a stripper pole. Mr. Gardner leaned back into the sofa and rested his feet on the table. He recently did an I.C.O. for a start-up after-party. “You can I.C.O. anything,” he said. He runs Distributed, a 180-page magazine about cryptocurrency that comes out about once a year. He is now raising $75 million for his hedge fund, Ausum Ventures (pronounced “awesome”). He said his closest friends are moving to Puerto Rico to get around paying taxes. “They’re going to build a modern-day Atlantis out there,” he said. “But for me, it’s too early in my career to check out.” Advertisement He wears a bracelet from his Burning Man camp (Mayan Warrior) and a necklace that is a key on a chain. “I was given this necklace and was told my net worth would go up, and it’s gone up six x since then,” he said. He drew a chart to explain the crypto community: 20 percent for ideology, 60 percent for the tech and 100 percent for the money, he said, drawing a circle around it all. A roommate on the sofa perked up and asked if he’d ever invest in his lucid dreams start-up (the idea is a headpiece that induces them). Mr. Gardner did not seem impressed: “Probably not,” he said. A reality show wants to follow him around, but he’s skeptical that it can add to his life. “I literally have a date with Bella Hadid not having a reality show,” he said. A few weeks after we first met, as the Bitcoin price exploded in December, Mr. Gardner seemed shaken. People had begun making pilgrimages to the Crypto Castle, knocking on the door, hoping Mr. Gardner could help them invest. “Nothing feels real, it doesn’t feel real,” he said. “I’m ready for crypto assets to go down 90 percent. I’ll feel better then, I think. This has been too insane.” Nearby is a building residents call the Crypto Crackhouse. Grant Hummer, who runs the San Francisco Ethereum Meetup, lives there. Long hallways called Bitcoin Boulevard and Ethereum Alley lead to communal bathrooms. Mr. Hummer and his co-founder committed $40 million of their own crypto-made money to their new $100 million hedge fund, Chromatic Capital. “My neurons are fried from all the volatility,” Mr. Hummer said. “I don’t even care at this point. I’m numb to it. I’ll lose a million dollars in a day and I’m like, O.K.” His room is simple: a bed, a futon, a TV on a mostly empty media console, three keyboard cleaning sprays and a half dozen canisters of Lysol wipes. His T-shirt read, ‘The Lizard of Wall Street,’ with a picture of a lizard in a suit, dollar-sign necklaces around its neck. He carries with him a coin that reads, “memento mori,” to remind himself he can die any day. He sees the boom as part of a global apocalypse. Advertisement “The worse regular civilization does and the less you trust, the better crypto does,” Mr. Hummer said. ""It’s almost like the ultimate short trade.” Mr. Hummer went out to meet Joe Buttram, 27, for drinks. As a mixed martial arts fighter, Mr. Buttram said he would fight for a couple hundred bucks, sometimes a few thousand, and worked security at a start-up, but his main hobbies were reading 4chan and buying vintage pornography, passions that exposed him to cryptocurrency. He said his holdings are into double-digit millions but wouldn’t give specifics other than to say he’d quit his job and is starting a hedge fund. There’s a common paranoia among the crypto-wealthy that they’ll be targeted and robbed since there’s no bank securing the money, so many are obsessively secretive. Many say even their parents don’t know how much they’ve made. This also allows people to pretend to be wealthier than they are, of course. “It’s unforgiving,” Mr. Buttram said. “You make one mistake and it’s all gone.” They talk about buying Lamborghinis, the single acceptable way to spend money in the Ethereum cryptocurrency community. The currency’s founder frequently appears in fan art as Jesus with a Lamborghini. Mr. Buttram says he’s renting an orange Lambo for the weekend. And he wears a solid gold Bitcoin “B” necklace encrusted with diamonds that he had made. Otherwise, HODL. This is one of the core beliefs in this community: HODL, “hold” typed very fast, as if in a panic. HODL even if you feel FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you show wealth, it means you don’t really believe in the cryptocurrency revolution, a full remake of the financial system, governments and our world order that will send the price of ether up astronomically. “HODL when everyone has FUD,” Mr. Hummer said quietly, to explain why he still lives in a dorm room. “This will change civilization. This can 100 x or more from here.”  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.

He knows this is strange. “When I meet people in the normal world now, I get bored,” Mr. Hummer said. “It’s just a different level of consciousness.” The tone turns somber. “Sometimes I think about what would happen to the future if a bomb went off at one of our meetings,” Mr. Buttram said. Mr. Hummer said, “A bomb would set back civilization for years.” A few days later, Mr. Hummer was working from his co-founder’s apartment. James Fickel, 26, lives in a high-rise with a Russian blue cat called Mr. Bigglesworth. Mr. Fickel is known in the community for “going full YOLO” and investing $400,000 when Ethereum was at 80 cents. Now, with a fortune he says is in the hundreds of millions, his parents have retired and sent his younger sister to live with him. Advertisement “I’m taking over her education,” Mr. Fickel said, sitting on a white leather sofa, Mr. Bigglesworth asleep in his impossibly skinny arms. Today, Mr. Fickel is outlining the endgame for cryptocurrency true believers. “It’s the entire world reorganizing itself,” Mr. Fickel said. “We could get rid of our armies because for the first time you’ll have people saying, ‘I want to vote for a global order.’ It’s the internet waking up — it’s the internet grabbing its pitchfork. That’s the blockchain.” Mr. Hummer is skeptical. “All I know is the price of ether is going to go up,” Mr. Hummer said. At a jazz bar a few days later, I run into Mr. Fickel’s personal trainer, Alan Chen, who is now running in this crypto circle. Mr. Fickel had convinced Mr. Chen to put his savings into Ethereum. “I’m retired, man,” Mr. Chen said. “I’m moving to L.A. next week. I got a penthouse on Marina del Rey.” “Don’t say I’m retired,” he added. “I’m going into business now. I’m going to use blockchain to help personal trainers.” Nearby was Chante Eliaszadeh, 22, a law student at the University of California, Berkeley, who started the Berkeley Law Blockchain group. “Obviously the bubble’s going to burst and everyone’s going to need a lawyer,” she said. At the annual San Francisco Bitcoin Meetup Party, hundreds gathered under the fluorescent lights of a co-working space, and there was a line out the door. The waiting list had to be told not to show up. Many there wore Bitcoin- and Ethereum-themed clothes from Hodlmoon, which sells unisex cryptocurrency sweaters. Advertisement Those closest to the technology are the most cautious. Pieter Wuille, 33, a Bitcoin core developer, kept his backpack on as he wandered the party. He’s part of the team working to develop the Bitcoin technology. “The technology still needs time to evolve,” Mr. Wuille said. ""This infusion of interest is bringing the wrong kind of attention. Some people believe Bitcoin can’t fail or this technology solves many more problems than it does. It can. And it does not.” He said everyone is asking him whether to buy Bitcoin. “I tell them I have no idea,” he said. “I don’t know!” “There’s so many people rushing into the space, if it’s a bit of speculation, I’m O.K. with that,” said the Coinbase C.E.O., Brian Armstrong, whose company has become the de facto portal for casual investors. “But we can’t guarantee the website’s going to be up exactly when you need it. Everyone needs to take a deep breath.” As the holiday party filled up, a cryptocurrency rapper called CoinDaddy — Arya Bahmanyar, 28 — was getting ready to perform. Formerly a commercial real estate agent, Mr. Bahmanyar works full time at CoinDaddy after becoming a self-described crypto-millionaire (“you think I would dress up like this if I wasn’t?”). “Right now all our entertainers come from outside crypto culture — not inside crypto, and we’ve got to change that,” he said. He pointed to his outfit — a long white fake mink coat, gold-heeled shoes — and said, “It’s gold, right? It’s gold. It’s a niche, and I’m going to fill it.” He says he is going to shoot a music video soon for a song called “Lambo Party” and another called “Cryptomom,” about “all these moms are pumping in their children’s savings accounts.” Advertisement Maria Lomeli, 56, came to the party to find the people she had put a lot of trust in. A housekeeper from Pacifica, Calif., she said she had invested $12,000 in cryptocurrencies over the last few weeks after reading about it in the news. She wore running shoes and a zip-up jacket that said, “Cinemark, the best seats in town.” She worked there cleaning out theaters. Now she cleans houses. Banks, she said, were designed to steal. Taxes left her supporting a government that she felt didn’t support her. “Charges for sending money to my daughter, interest on our loans,” she said. ""And then the money we pay in taxes goes to wars and whatever else they want.” She found a Bitcoin event in the city and asked people there how to buy Bitcoin on her phone. She invested $1,000. It went up. So she put in $10,000 more, she said, along with $1,000 in a currency called Litecoin. Both her children have discouraged this. “And maybe I’m going to lose it,” she said. “Maybe I’m going to keep cleaning houses. But something is telling me I can trust this generation. My instinct is telling me this is the future.” She had to leave the party early because parking downtown is expensive, she said. She zipped up her jacket and left on her own.

business,"By Reuters OMAHA, Neb. — Billionaire Warren Buffett has been buying a boatload of Apple Inc shares and on Saturday suggested he would buy even more shares at the right price. At Berkshire Hathaway Inc's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett credited Apple with developing ""extremely sticky"" products to which consumers become attached and endorsed Apple's decision to buy back its own stock, saying it was the technology company's most productive use of cash. ""We would love to see Apple go down in price,"" Buffett said. Berkshire is now Apple's third largest shareholder, behind Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc. ""I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares,"" Buffett said, just two days after he revealed having bought 75 million additional Apple shares, and four days after Apple said it may repurchase $100 billion of stock. At the end of 2017, Berkshire had owned 165.3 million shares. ""I love the idea of having our 5 percent, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7 percent without our laying out a dime."" And Buffett described it as a mistake that he never thought Alphabet Inc's Google and Amazon.com Inc made sense as investments for Berkshire. Buffett, 87, and his longtime partner and fellow billionaire Charlie Munger, 94, also took pointed questions on China, Wells Fargo & Co, guns, healthcare and their investment choices from shareholders, journalists and analysts at the more-than-six-hour meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. The questions also elicited views on politics from the ""Oracle of Omaha"" and Munger. Buffett said it was unlikely that the United States and China would come to loggerheads on trade and believed the countries would avoid doing ""something extremely foolish."" ""The United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long time,"" Buffett said, and that any tensions should not jeopardize the win-win benefits from trade. ""It is just too big and too obvious ... that the benefits are huge and the world is dependent on it in a major way for its progress, that two intelligent countries (would) do something extremely foolish,"" he said. ""We both may do things that are mildly foolish from time to time."" The Trump administration has drawn a hard line in trade talks with Beijing, demanding a $200 billion cut in the Chinese trade surplus with the United States, sharply lower tariffs and advanced technology subsidies, people familiar with the talks said on Friday. Buffett suggested U.S. President Donald Trump should be an ""educator-in-chief"" on the invisible benefits of trade. Munger, meanwhile, answered a question on steel tariffs imposed by the White House by acknowledging that U.S. producers are hurting. ""Even Donald Trump can be right on some of this stuff,"" he said. Asked why Buffett was willing to do business with gun makers, he retorted, ""I do not believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.""  The billionaire investor said U.S. corporate tax cuts were good for shareholders but cautioned that the long-term effects of economic choices could be hard to gauge. And Buffett predicted ""bad endings"" for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, and said long-term U.S. government bonds were a terrible investment because inflation would consume their returns. CARDINAL SIN Buffett defended Wells Fargo and its chief executive, Tim Sloan, when asked when Berkshire would ditch the bank, one of its largest common stock holdings. Many shareholders applauded the question. Buffett said the bank had committed the ""cardinal sin"" of incentivizing employees into ""kind of crazy conduct."" U.S. regulators imposed $1 billion of fines last month over lending abuses. But he maintained that the bank was not ""inferior,"" as an investment or morally, to its main rivals. Berkshire owned $25.2 billion of Wells Fargo stock as of March 31, down 14 percent from year end as a series of scandals weighed on the bank's reputation. Wells Fargo investors last week gave strong backing to the bank's directors and executives on Tuesday, indicating confidence in its overhauled leadership to rebound. Buffett addressed his alliance with another banker, JPMorgan Chase & Co's Jamie Dimon, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos to tackle healthcare. Buffett said U.S. healthcare costs are a tapeworm on the economy, and he said the venture partners expect to name a chief executive within a couple months. CASH STOCKPILE Buffett faces a challenge investing Berkshire's more than $108 billion of cash and equivalents, including for acquisitions, saying his ""phone is not ringing off the hook with good deals."" Shortly before the meeting, Berkshire ended its more than year-long stretch of falling operating profit, while a new accounting rule caused the conglomerate chaired by Warren Buffett to suffer an overall net loss. Buffett said the net results were not representative of the business. The accounting change required Berkshire to report unrealized losses in its equity portfolio, which totaled $170.5 billion at year end, regardless of whether it planned to sell those stocks. Berkshire's net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with profit of $4.06 billion a year earlier.  But operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 49 percent to a record $5.29 billion, or about $3,215 per Class A share, higher than the $3,116 per share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GIDDY SHAREHOLDERS Shareholders have been enthusiastic about Berkshire, which sent out slightly more tickets to this year's extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett's 50th year at the helm. An even larger audience likely watched online via Yahoo Finance. Outside the convention center, Berkshire shareholders lined up for prime seats in the middle of the night. William Robertson, a Scotland native who fights fires and does forestry work in Switzerland, said he lined up at 11:30 p.m. Friday, 7-1/2 hours before doors opened. This year's meeting is his third. ""It gets me first place in the queue, I think when people go to so much effort it shows Warren how important he is for us,"" Robertson said.

business,"By Nick Wingfield SEATTLE — The other week, 218 cities and states lost in the sweepstakes to be the home of Amazon’s second headquarters, failing to make the list of 20 finalists. But Amazon thanks them for playing. That is because the hundreds of applications gave Amazon a hidden benefit: free research that the company can mine when picking spots for future warehouses and satellite offices. Amazon asked every city and state applying for its second headquarters for details about local resources, like available talent and transit options. Local officials were also prodded for tips on local education programs and tax incentives. The answers — most of which have not been released publicly — essentially do Amazon’s homework for it, providing valuable information that the company otherwise would have needed to dig up on its own or obtain through one-on-one negotiations. The application from the Kansas City, Mo., region detailed a program for teaching technical skills to preschoolers through 12th graders, according to a person briefed on the submissions, who would speak only anonymously because the discussions were private. A local coalition that helps military veterans make the transition to civilian jobs, which could help Amazon’s efforts to recruit veterans, also caught the company’s eye. The company did not realize until it saw the application from Louisville, Ky., the person said, that there is a large pool of technical talent within 200 miles of the city and a local public-private partnership that helps train students to become entry-level software developers. The Montreal submission stood out, the person said, with its thinking about attracting foreign talent to the region. Amazon alluded to the upside of the information last week when Holly Sullivan, its head of economic development, said the rejected locations could receive a consolation prize of sorts. “Through this process we learned about many new communities across North America that we will consider as locations for future infrastructure investment and job creation,” she said in a statement. Amazon’s plans are another illustration of how its search contest is about more than a second headquarters, or HQ2, as the company calls it. The winning location, Amazon says, will get up to 50,000 high-paying jobs and billions of dollars in construction. Those promises have generated extraordinary genuflection from politicians across North America, and a lot of glowing news coverage, at a moment of heightened scrutiny about Amazon’s market power. By getting 238 communities to give their best pitch, Amazon has also gotten insight into the kinds of accommodations that places are willing to make to bring it to town. “This is not just about HQ2,” said Richard Florida, an authority on urban development and a professor at the University of Toronto. “It’s about a broader locational strategy. HQ2 is the carrot. That’s the only thing that makes sense.” The proposal from Detroit, which did not make the final 20, offers another peek into the sort of incentives that Amazon has received from the HQ2 bids, and how the inducements could factor into Amazon’s planning for other projects. The city offered to let Amazon operate for 30 years without paying real estate and personal property taxes and a variety of other local taxes, according to a report in Crain’s Detroit Business. Ari B. Adler, a spokesman for Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, confirmed the report’s accuracy. Mr. Adler said Amazon’s bidding process would make Detroit a stronger contender for any company looking for a new or expanded location. Amazon already has other facilities in the state, and Michigan welcomes more of them, he said. “We heard from Amazon that some of the key things in our favor during the review process were our commitment to partnerships, the creativity of our proposal and the investments being made in the region’s growth,” Mr. Adler said. Only about 40,000 of Amazon’s 540,000 global employees work in Seattle, its home base. Its work force is largely spread across warehouses and other parts of the logistics network that deliver the billions of items Amazon ships every year. There are more than 300 warehouses and other shipping centers in the United States alone, according to estimates by MWPVL International, a supply chain and logistics consulting firm. The company is adding new ones at a fast clip. Amazon warehouses are often close to metropolitan areas so orders can be delivered to population centers as quickly as possible. A company site selection team scouts potential locations. The company also has more than a dozen satellite offices focused on research and development — Amazon calls them “tech hubs.” It has a large robotics unit near Boston, a machine translation team in Pittsburgh and a video game development group in San Diego. State and local officials have been enthusiastic about the jobs at the warehouses, offering tax breaks and raving about Amazon’s arrival in news releases. Since 2000, Amazon has received over $1.1 billion in public subsidies for its facilities and other operations, according to estimates by Good Jobs First, a nonpartisan research group that tracks economic development. Mark Williams, president of the Strategic Development Group, a site selection consulting firm, said available tax breaks, like those offered by Detroit, could be one of the most important pieces of information for Amazon. “There are discretionary incentives that aren’t on the books that come in the heat of a deal,” Mr. Williams said. “In most cases, those are the most valuable incentives.” But he said the bids could also show a community’s willingness to offer other benefits. “There are special grant funds, special bond funds, naming of roads,” he said. “It’s not like you can acquire these through a data search.” Mr. Florida, the urban studies professor, advised Kansas City (an also-ran) and Toronto (a finalist) on their bids. He believes Amazon also “has something in mind” for the 20 places still in the game — including Indianapolis, Miami and Columbus, Ohio. The company is talking to all 20 and getting even more information from them. “What is a better distribution hub than Columbus or Indianapolis?” Mr. Florida said. “What is a better Latin America headquarters than Miami?” One of the finalists, Denver, whose bid has been made public, provided Amazon with elaborate breakdowns of the number of students who graduated from Colorado from 2014 to 2016 with degrees in computer engineering, computer graphics, information technology, tax law and human resources management. The city boasted about the large number of faculty at the University of Colorado, in nearby Boulder, focused on computer science. Denver also suggested a handful of possible development sites for Amazon, though those locations were redacted from the public material. “There is no better place for Amazon’s second home than Colorado,” John W. Hickenlooper, the state’s governor, said in a cover letter with its application addressed to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "

business,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin JAN. 30, 2018
 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase are teaming up to form a health care company. • Ken Chenault is moving to venture capital. • JPMorgan has (and hasn’t) clarified its succession plans. • What should we expect in tonight’s State of the Union speech? Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Health care stocks fell on news that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan are partnering to form a venture to lower the health care costs of their employees. The e-commerce giant has so disrupted businesses from booksellers to grocers to department stores over its two decades as a public company that just the mere mention of it entering a new sector spooks investors. And with good reason. Amazon could spend huge sums, and bear years of losses, to win customers with lower prices. Advertisement But beyond that threat, there are some big questions looming over the initiative. 1) What is it? The venture will be an independent company that “is free from profit-making incentives and constraints.” That sounds liberating, and there is no reason to think it won’t be, but such visionary language would pack a bigger punch if it was accompanied by hard cash. The release did not give details about the initial investment in the venture. Advertisement 2) How big will it really be? The effort focuses on the United States employees of JPMorgan Chase, Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway. Together, the companies have nearly one million employees (a portion of those, though, are outside of the United States.) That’s a lot of employees but relatively small when compared with 157 million people who had employer health care plans at the end of 2016, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Would the venture be able to scale up? Some experts are skeptical about that. Ben Gomes-Casseres, a professor of international business at Brandeis, wrote: “My bet is that JPMorgan and Amazon’s employees have pretty good health coverage, with plans that rank among the richest that the industry has to offer. If so, will these lead users be anxious to find a more cost-effective model? Will they even be willing to experiment with their coverage? And, beyond that – if they do develop a new approach, will it be helpful to the masses of employees at lesser companies, or, worse, the unemployed and uninsured?” 3) Do these companies bring valuable expertise to providing health care at a lower cost? It’s not clear how much more expertise Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have than companies that have been operating in health care for decades. Amazon could have gotten into pharmacy services years ago, if it had wanted, which means it might have seen complexities and risks that don’t exist in other sectors. Berkshire brings a strong insurance specialization, but not in providing health insurance directly to the consumer. What is more, Berkshire’s point man in the joint health care effort will be Todd Combs, an investor who does not come from the insurance operations of the company. 4) If the high cost of health care is the main problem, what can this venture do to cut costs? Much depends on whether the effort can address the main reason that health care spending has gone up in the United States versus other countries. A recent Upshot column showed how much of the rise is a result of more being done for patients during hospital stays and doctor visits, or that they are charged more for those services. One way to assess the brash new initiative from Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon is whether it does anything to address this dynamic. — Peter Eavis That’s how Warren Buffett referred to the nation’s “ballooning costs of health care” Tuesday. Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway announced it is teaming up with JPMorgan Chase and Amazon to form an independent health care company to serve their employees in the United States. The three companies provided few details about the new entity, other than saying it would initially focus on technology to provide simplified, high-quality health care for their employees and their families, and at a reasonable cost. They said the initiative, which is in the early planning stages, would be a long-term effort “free from profit-making incentives and constraints.” Mr. Buffett’s concern about rising health care costs is not new, nor is his use of “tapeworm” to describe them. Mr. Buffett’s statement Tuesday echoes other recent comments he has made on the subject. He trotted out the tapeworm metaphor to describe rising medical costs during television interviews in 2010 and 2012, MoneyBeat’s Ben Eisen and Erik Holm point out. Advertisement At Berkshire’s annual meeting in May, he said: “Medical costs are the tapeworm of American economic competitiveness.” In fact, Mr. Buffett use of the tapeworm metaphor to describe drags on the economy dates back more than three-and-a-half decades at least. Mr. Buffett wrote in his 1981 shareholder letter: “Inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.” Then in his 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, he wrote: “Citizens and public officials typically under-appreciated the gigantic financial tapeworm that was born when promises were made that conflicted with a willingness to fund them.” The smooth glide higher for U.S. stock markets may be hitting a bumpier stretch. Volatility, as measured by the widely followed C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped nearly 30 percent in recent days as investors paused to consider the ongoing sell-off in the United States dollar and rising yields on United States government debt. The S.&P. 500 stock index dropped roughly 0.7 percent early Tuesday and could notch its second consecutive decline, something that hasn’t happened since mid-December. Low interest rates have been a key ingredient in the almost relentless rise in U.S. equity markets. But with the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury now above 2.70 percent, its highest level in four years, that backdrop could be changing. — Matt Phillips Despite being inundated by post-American Express job offers, Ken Chenault has chosen an interesting path: becoming chairman and managing partner of General Catalyst Partners, which has invested in Airbnb, Warby Parker and Stripe, among others. Advertisement More interesting is why he’s taking the job, Andrew writes in his latest DealBook column. He’s hoping to be the adult in the room for the next generation of start-ups, after the troubles at Uber, SoFi and more. Here’s what he told Andrew: “Given their age and the scale and size and impact that they can have on our society, unless they make a step up, we are going to have some serious problems,” Mr. Chenault said. “And we do have serious problems.” “Companies are starting to realize that they are growing up, and in growing up, they have to assume some broader responsibilities,” he added. “Companies are at different stages, from a self awareness standpoint, in accepting that reality.” In selecting Rob Shafir — previously the head of Credit Suisse’s American operations — as the successor to Daniel Och, the hedge fund has apparently laid to rest questions about its leadership planning. A reminder: Before Mr. Shafir, Mr. Och’s chosen successor was James Levin. Then the two men had a falling out. Mr. Och’s statement: “Rob is a world-class executive who will be a great asset to Oz as we continue our evolution as a firm. His distinguished career of over 30 years leading global financial institutions and asset management businesses brings unique experience that will benefit Oz significantly.” And a statement by Mr. Levin, who had weighed quitting — but was identified in today’s statement as still being Och-Ziff’s co-chief investment officer: “Oz is a tremendous firm with a talented and creative team that works each day to identify and execute on the most compelling investment opportunities around the world. I am excited about the future and look forward to welcoming Rob.” — Michael J. de la Merced The JPMorgan Chase chief said yesterday that he plans to stick around another five years. So who will eventually pick up the baton? In the short term: It could be Daniel Pinto, the head of JPMorgan’s investment bank, or Gordon Smith, the head of its consumer bank. They were named co-presidents yesterday — but Mr. Pinto is 55 and Mr. Smith is 59. In the longer term: It could be one of the other executives named in the firm’s statement: • Mary Erdoes, 50, who runs the asset and wealth management arm • Doug Petno, 52, who runs the commercial banking division • Marianne Lake, 48, the C.F.O. “The board and Dimon both believe that under all timing scenarios, whether today or in the future, the company has several highly capable successors in place,” JPMorgan said in its statement. But the firm has had trouble holding onto potential successors over the years. The political question: Mr. Dimon has said publicly that he isn’t going to run for president. (There’s been speculation, and friends are still encouraging him to try.) Advertisement Critics’ corner • Antony Currie writes, “JPMorgan has given Jamie Dimon the freedom to outstay his welcome.” (Breakingviews) • Lex writes, “As murky as the future is, the situation at JPMorgan is probably preferable to Goldman, where there is a ferocious thinly-disguised competition between the two co-presidents for the top job.” (FT) Surely jobs and the economy, given how often he has spoken on those topics (including at the World Economic Forum in Davos). Politico also suggests infrastructure, immigration, trade and national security. But here are the big questions: • Will President Trump stick to the script and focus on issues like spending $1 trillion on infrastructure? • How hard will he press the White House immigration proposal? Democrats are opposed, and the next shutdown deadline is Feb. 8. • Will he touch on health care, given that Republicans have so far rolled back only a small portion of the Affordable Care Act? • Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee voted to release a contentious memo alleging improprieties in the surveillance of a Trump campaign associate.

He worked on InBev’s takeover of Anheuser Busch and Reynolds American’s takeover of Lorillard. (He also sold D.E. Master Blenders to JAB, the investment firm that later bought Keurig.) But Mr. Weiss left Lazard to become a counselor at the Treasury Department under the Obama administration, taking on issues like Puerto Rico’s debt crisis and new lending marketplaces. Since then He’s become a senior fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard’s Kennedy School, and a director at the Volcker Alliance. He has considered getting back into investment banking, and has been courted by many a bank. And he might yet start his own shop. Companies want to go public.

business,"Common Sense By James B. Stewart Over the last half decade, few stocks have been more beloved by investors and Wall Street analysts than Facebook. No wonder: After a rocky initial public offering in 2012, it has rolled over one obstacle after another, including the shift to mobile computing and the rise of photo sharing. It delivered revenue and user growth that surpassed even the most optimistic projections. By the end of last year, Facebook had 2.2 billion active users. Its stock rose 53 percent last year, single-handedly accounting for 3.7 percent of the 21.8 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, according to S.&P. Dow Jones Indices. By early February, its market capitalization had surpassed $560 billion, making it the fifth most valuable company in the index. By then Facebook alone accounted for nearly 2 percent of the S.&P. 500 index, which means that anyone who owns a broad-based stock mutual fund or index fund probably owns Facebook shares. Sophisticated investors and institutions, too, have considerable exposure: Goldman Sachs analysts reported last month that Facebook was the second most widely held stock (after Amazon) by hedge funds. Over 90 percent of Wall Street analysts covering the company deemed Facebook a “buy” in early February, even though, at $195 a share, its price-to-earnings ratio, a common valuation measure, was a lofty 35. (The average ratio now is about 24; historically, it has been about 15.) It was, as Wall Street pundits like to say, “priced for perfection.” Whatever else can be said about Facebook’s recent tribulations, this much is certain: Its situation is far from perfection. After revelations that data harvested from Facebook may have been used to try to influence Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the United States presidential election, the social network giant faces multiple investigations in both Europe and the United States, along with potentially profit-crimping regulations and limits to its use of data. And investor retribution has been swift. Since hitting its peak on Feb. 2, Facebook has lost an astonishing $100 billion in market capitalization. Its stock was trading midweek at close to $153 a share, a decline of nearly 22 percent. (It rebounded by about 4.5 percent Thursday and closed at $159.79.) With Facebook’s plunge, investor concerns have spread to other social media and internet stocks with lofty multiples, like the so-called FANG stocks — Facebook, Apple and Amazon, Netflix and Google — and Twitter. They accounted for more than 10 percent of the S.&P. 500 at their peak. “People who own an index fund need to realize how important Facebook is, and how big a role it and the FANG stocks played in the market’s rise,” said Howard Silverblatt, senior industry analyst for the S.&P. Dow Jones Indices, who oversees statistical analysis for the S.&P. 500. “The FANG leadership is faltering. Social media hasn’t faced much regulation, and now there’s a cloud hanging over those companies.” In the midst of past Facebook euphoria, few saw this coming. One that did was Aiera, a robot that uses artificial intelligence to make stock recommendations. Aiera, an acronym for artificially intelligent equity research analyst, put out a “sell” recommendation for Facebook last fall. So did Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research Group  who covers media and internet companies. Although he was positive about the stock for most of its long climb, he downgraded Facebook to “sell” last summer based on regulatory and advertiser concerns and what he now considers “systemic management issues.” Not only was it a lonely position, but “the stock went up and up,” Mr. Wieser told me this week. “But I thought the market was wrong, full stop.” “I didn’t know what the catalyst would be, but at some point revenue growth had to slow and the margins go down,” he said. “There are practical limits. And I felt investors were looking at Facebook in much too positive a light. They just ignored all the bad things, and there were a lot of them.” Then, when the news broke this month that a British firm, Cambridge Analytica, had used Facebook data for voter profiling, Mr. Wieser said, he thought it was “the most significant thing that had happened to Facebook since it became a public company.” “Most people hadn’t given much thought to how their data is used,” he added. “But this really exposed the potential abuse. This is digital advertising’s original sin, and there’s going to be a reckoning that even now I don’t think most investors fully appreciate.” The other Facebook skeptic, Aiera, can talk, but Wells Fargo — whose global internet analyst, Ken Sena, developed the robot along with Bryan Healey — wasn’t making its wunderkind available for interviews. But based on Aiera’s published comments, it issued its sell recommendation after analyzing the frequency of negative mentions in the media of Russia’s use of Facebook to influence the presidential election, as well as fundamental valuation and technical factors. (Aiera uses artificial intelligence to read and analyze a half-million pieces of data per day gleaned from the internet. It currently analyzes more than 1,600 stocks.) Wells Fargo has stressed that Aiera remains in experimental mode, but one potential advantage is that it removes all human emotion from its analysis. Thus, Aiera was indifferent to the fact that nearly every other analyst had a buy recommendation on Facebook. That included her putative master, Mr. Sena, who was thrust into the somewhat awkward position of explaining his own buy recommendation even as Aiera said sell. When I spoke to him this week, Mr. Sena stressed that Aiera was a tool that could detect patterns and eliminate bias. “Aiera said election interference was a big deal, and it turned out it was a big deal,” Mr. Sena said. “But it’s not meant to supplant human judgments.” He hasn’t changed his buy recommendation even though he agrees with Mr. Wieser that investors need to take threats of regulation seriously. “The conventional wisdom was that people don’t care that much about how their data is used,” Mr. Sena said. “They like the convenience of targeted advertising. But the level of public outcry over this is new.’’ “Facebook is going to have to do a lot of explaining,’’ he added. “I believe they have the capability and the technology to make the platform secure. But it’s going to distract from other initiatives investors are counting on for growth, like virtual reality and video content.” Even so, Facebook’s decline has been so steep that even Mr. Wieser and Aiera may reassess their recommendations if they calculate that the stock has bottomed out. When he last reiterated his sell recommendation, Mr. Wieser’s price target was $152. “I don’t want to be trigger happy on this,” he said. “It’s not clear yet what happens next. I want to fine-tune my thoughts before I revisit this.” Aiera canceled her sell recommendation after the stock plunged. She hasn’t yet made a new recommendation. Of 45 analysts who cover Facebook, 41 currently have a “buy” or “overweight” recommendation, up from 39 a month ago. Mr. Sena is even more bullish on Facebook than he was before, and hasn’t changed his price target of $230. “People are still glued to Facebook and Instagram,” he said. Its price-to-earnings ratio is now just 28, barely above the market average, which makes it “the cheapest stock in our coverage area, and it has some of the best growth prospects,” he said. “There’s no way mathematically to justify a loss of more than $70 billion in market cap.”    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
business,"Common Sense By James B. Stewart In the midst of a long-running bull market that is now reaching momentous proportions, most investors may well have forgotten that just two years ago, during the first five trading days of 2016, the market dropped 6 percent. It was the worst five-day start to a year ever and supposedly a harbinger of bad times. We know where that ended. Spurred by Donald Trump’s election that November, market indexes surged to record levels and went far higher this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 19 percent in 2017, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 25 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite leapt 28 percent. There wasn’t a single day last year when the S.&P. 500 fluctuated more than 2 percent, a level of low volatility unseen since the mid-1960s, according to James Stack, a market historian and president of InvesTech Research. In a rare convergence, investor euphoria spread across the globe. A measure of market performance, the MSCI All Country World Index, gained 22.7 percent last year, closing at a record high. And so far this year, stocks have continued their advance. On Thursday, the Dow broke the 25,000 barrier for the first time, and technology stocks are soaring to new highs. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are adding a whiff of bubblelike mania. And that may not be such good news for investors. “If there are any certainties, one will be that this party will eventually come to an end,” Mr. Stack said. “A correction would be healthy. The longer we go without one, the greater the risk this will end badly. A lot of people will get hurt. And when it ends, it will end badly, and with high volatility.” That doesn’t mean the end is imminent, according to Mr. Stack and other investment managers and market experts I interviewed this week. All of them successfully navigated markets last year, when the greatest risk was being underinvested. “Everybody thinks the market is overvalued,” said Jerome L. Dodson, the founder and president of Parnassus Investments. “So do I. I’m expecting a correction, but I was expecting one after Trump was elected. I was wrong. The market can keep going up even when it’s overvalued.” Mr. Dodson didn’t move into cash last year, and his Parnassus Endeavor Fund, where he’s the portfolio manager, gained nearly 20 percent last year and is ranked by Morningstar as the No. 1 fund in its category (large-cap growth) over three-, five- and 10-year periods. President Trump has routinely celebrated, and taken credit for, the stock market’s record-setting climb during his first year in office. “Most seasoned investors realize this market is overvalued and overbought and it’s been a long time since a normal correction,” Mr. Stack said. “They’re nervous.” Nonetheless, he said he was 82 percent invested in stocks, with 18 percent in cash, only slightly more than usual. He said he had learned from decades of market experience that “overvaluation isn’t what causes bear markets — it never has and never will.” In addition, he said, “there’s going to be tremendous political pressure to keep the party going,” especially since Mr. Trump has so often cited the bull market as evidence of the success of his presidency. So what should investors do? It’s probably no surprise that Burton G. Malkiel, the renowned emeritus professor of economics at Princeton and author of the 1973 classic “A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing,” recommends that investors “stay the course.” “If the sharp rise in the stock market in 2017 has unbalanced your portfolio with a higher proportion of equities than is consistent with your risk tolerance, then you could do some rebalancing by trimming the equities down to the proportion at which you are comfortable,” Mr. Malkiel said. “But do not try to time the market. Nobody can consistently time the market, and those who try it usually fail.” Although Mr. Malkiel is a longtime champion of passive, low-cost index investing, a strategy that has worked well since the financial crisis, last year he endorsed an “advanced indexing” approach at the automated investment manager Wealthfront, where he is chief investment adviser. Wealthfront aims to outperform strictly passive investing, and its taxable portfolio returned 20.56 percent last year, which indeed beat its benchmark. Mr. Dodson is an active manager who focuses on stock selection. “I’ve never had a good record at market timing,” he said. “I look for stocks that are undervalued, but I’m having terrible trouble finding anything that’s reasonably priced.” Technology stocks in general “are way overvalued,” he said. He has cut back on his fund’s large positions in Micron Technologies, Apple and Applied Materials after they notched big gains. With benefit of hindsight, he wouldn’t have sold them, “but someone once asked Bernard Baruch how he became so rich,” Mr. Dodson said. “‘I made my money by selling too soon,’” the famed financier replied. Still, there are “a few” undervalued opportunities, Mr. Dodson said. He cited the health care sector: The biotech concern Gilead Sciences and the generic-drug maker Perrigo are two of his fund’s largest holdings. The toymaker Mattel “is on the bargain table,” he said. And even in technology, his fund has a large position in Qualcomm, currently fighting a takeover bid by the rival chip-maker Broadcom. If so much is indeed overvalued, then this year’s market could well reward discerning active managers. “I worry about the index funds,” Mr. Dodson said. “They’re getting close to 25 percent in technology, given the high valuations and market caps. If there’s a reversal, it’s going to hit the index funds hard. This may finally be the year that active managers outperform.” Mr. Stack agreed. “Active management isn’t about beating the market but about achieving market gains within a defined acceptance of risk,” he said. “There are selective opportunities, but you have to dig to find them. None are true bargains anymore.” He recently bought shares in the diversified industrial manufacturer Ingersoll Rand and is moving his portfolio toward more defensive positions in consumer staples, energy and materials. “I’d rather be early with portfolio defenses and leave some profits on the table than go into a bear market fully exposed,” he said. Mr. Stack said that in examining bull markets over the past 50 years, he had found that both the technology and energy sectors outperformed in the late stages of a bull market. He said investors “should have some portion of their portfolio in the materials sector, notably energy, which had been so out of favor” until mid-2017. In my outlook column last year, Damien Courvalin, head of energy research for Goldman Sachs’s Global Investment Research commodities team, was uncannily accurate in forecasting that oil prices would recover in 2017 and stabilize at $55 to $60 per barrel. (West Texas intermediate crude oil futures ended the year at $60.42.) So I asked him what his team was predicting this year. “From a total-return perspective, it’s quite compelling to be invested in commodities,” he said — even though he doesn’t see oil prices rising much above current levels by year’s end. That’s because, thanks to the shale oil revolution, producers outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can easily ramp up production when prices are $60 to $65. But commodities investors can still make a profit, he said, by betting on stable to rising prices in the futures market. Like Mr. Stack, Mr. Courvalin noted that commodities and energy typically do well in the late stages of an economic expansion. Non-energy commodities may do even better, since they have no equivalent to shale and mining companies can’t increase production quickly in response to rising prices. In the mining sector, “margins are improving, orders are picking up, and we’re seeing new investment,” he said. It may seem a paradox that investors’ worries about the coming year are mounting even as the economic outlook seems so bright. “Investors are struggling with this market because the skies are blue,” Mr. Stack said. “It’s rare when you have an investing climate like this one, where it’s all but impossible to find something to worry about, either domestically or globally.” But that’s true in the late stages of most bull markets, he said, meaning investors need to be alert. And while virtually no one can foresee the next catalyst for a correction or bear market, even a hint that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates more than expected would most likely set off seismic tremors. “Most bull markets die by the sword of the Fed,” Mr. Stack said.

business,"By Thomas B. Edsall Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. We may never stop arguing about which historic currents swept President Trump into the White House. Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum, is unlikely to have had Trump in mind when he described the fourth industrial revolution in Davos in January 2016: We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before. Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued, the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance. First Schwab looked at the bright side: The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing. Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many “workers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,” he said, and the “middle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.” We tend to think of immigration — now fracturing parties of the left and right both here and in Europe — as distinct from technological innovation, but the two issues are intertwined on many levels, even down to the fact that most unauthorized immigrants are people who fly here and overstay their visas, not those who cross rural borders on foot. And air travel is the least of it. In an August 2015 Times story, “A 21st-Century Migrant’s Essentials: Food, Shelter, Smartphone,” Matthew Brunwasser described the situation that obtains now: In this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends. Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, “Patterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century”: The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier. There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative. “The IT revolution improved living standards and its great technical achievements enjoy a high level of consumer and political support,” Mordecai Kurz, an economist at Stanford, wrote in a June 2017 paper. “However these sources of social benefits are also the cause of social losses and rising inequality that threaten the foundation of democratic society.” Schwab, a year earlier, had put it this way: There is an “inexorable shift from simple digitization (the Third Industrial Revolution) to innovation based on combinations of technologies (the Fourth Industrial Revolution).” With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences: As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor. Just to give a sense of the exponential nature of the rate of technological change, here’s how Sergey Brin described it in this year’s “Founders’ Letter,” which was released earlier this week: The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations — a factor of about 200,000 difference — and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second. In point of fact, the use of robots — and of other methods of replacing workers with machines — has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe. According to the International Federation of Robotics, “By regions, the average robot density per 10,000 employees in Europe is 99 units, in the Americas 84 and in Asia 63 units.” In a March 2018 paper, “We Were The Robots: Automation in Manufacturing and Voting Behavior in Western Europe,” Massimo Anelli, Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, of Bocconi University in Milan, found that “robot shock increases support for nationalist and radical right parties.” The authors note that “both technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.” “Job losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email: In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs. Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University — Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen — was crucial to Trump’s victory. In their October 2017 paper, “Political Machinery: Did Robots Swing the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election?” the authors demonstrate that Support for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College. Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper: AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (‘mid-skilled’) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services. In his paper, “Computers and Populism: Artificial Intelligence, Jobs and Politics in the Near Term,” Levy writes: On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization’s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs. Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, “there should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities” by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects. Surveying the trucking industry recently in “The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation,” Darrell West, a scholar at Brookings, warns that full adoption of driverless vehicles “would put at least 2.5 million drivers out of work.” Assessing the full range of employment, West observes that Robots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs. Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace, the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case. Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy’s answer is: farther down the ladder: AI’s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage work into such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services. For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women’s and reproductive rights movements.) Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers: Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook. What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill. Levy writes: A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the ""people” and the “elite” based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal “elites” who make a very good living developing robots to put “the people” out of work. While Levy looks at the issue from the vantage point of those harmed by A.I., robotics and information technology, Kurz, the Stanford economist, examines the economic winners. In a recent essay for Project Syndicate, he writes: IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial. The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks the dark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth. While operating legally — indeed with the full support of the legal system — contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz: Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors — additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs — then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms. According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences: Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion — equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income — in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points. The result is a cascading effect caused both by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular. Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, pointed out in a December 2017 paper, “Should We Be Reassured If Automation in the Future Looks Like Automation in the Past?” that The history of automation — and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades — suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation. Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs: The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience. Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in “the process of turnover,” which “could lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.” In the short run, not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this “short run” could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of “short runs” for even longer. A short run that lasts for decades — or a series of short runs that last even longer — would seem to warrant grave alarm. While much of the focus on job losses resulting from robotization and trade has been on men, a January 2018 study led by Saadia Zahidi, head of Education, Gender and Work, at the World Economic Forum, found that “among the workers affected by labor market disruptions, under both models, a larger share — 57 percent — are projected to be female.” A separate study of the potential consequences of automation in England, “Managing automation: Employment, inequality and ethics in the digital age,” written by Carys Roberts, Mathew Lawrence and Loren King, researchers at the Institute for Public Policy Research, found that Of all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology. Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade. Furman lists some initiatives: expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice. Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income. These proposals — some underwhelming or undoable — find strong support among Democratic elected officials. Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant — not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade. David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans. Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect. Expanding on Autor’s work, Andrea Cerrato and Francesco Ruggieri, of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and Federico Maria Ferrara, of the University of Geneva, wrote in their March 2018 paper, “Why Does Import Competition Favor Republicans? Localized Trade Shocks, Voting Behavior, and Scapegoating in the U.S.”: Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups. The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants “takes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.” In other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well. In highly polarized times, when partisans view victory by the opposition as a threat to the nation, Republicans will easily find ways to rationalize continued economic deterioration and the ongoing demonization of immigrants and minorities. They’ve had a lot of practice and they have effectively boxed themselves into a scapegoat strategy that capitalizes on — instead of improving — the suffering of many of their most loyal supporters. The hard core of Trump’s voters — more than half of all Republican voters don’t just approve of him, but strongly approve — have, in turn, demonstrated a willingness to deify the president no matter what he does or says — a deification dependent in no small part on Trump’s adoption of new communications technologies like Twitter. The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval — and the success of this strategy to date — suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics — if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.

business,"By Nick Wingfield and Jack Nicas For more than a decade, some of the best known technology companies, including Google, Facebook and Snap, have sold shares to the public while maintaining a corporate structure that allowed their founders to keep tight control over their companies. For Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, it was a way to protect themselves from pesky investors interested in short-term gains, even as shareholder advocates blasted the arrangements for creating unaccountable leaders. Now Zynga, a once high-flying maker of popular internet games such as FarmVille and Words With Friends, has taken the unusual step of scrapping its founder-friendly structure — a change that could make it easier for the company to sell itself down the line. The founder-empowered structure at the heart of many tech companies is known as a multiclass stock structure, under which those who started the company own a certain class of stock that gives them outsize voting power even after it goes public. At Zynga, Mark Pincus, the company’s founder, has now converted some of his shares that carry more voting clout — known as Class B and C shares — into common Class A shares. The conversion reduces his overall voting power at Zynga to about 10 percent from about 70 percent. Mr. Pincus will not see any change in his economic interest in the company from the conversion. The change comes as Mr. Pincus and his wife, Alison Gelb Pincus, are going through a divorce. Last year, publications in San Francisco, where Zynga is based, speculated that the divorce could jeopardize his control over Zynga. Ms. Pincus is challenging a prenuptial agreement with her husband, according to a document filed in California Superior Court. An attorney for Ms. Pincus did not respond to a request for comment. In a phone interview, Mr. Pincus said his divorce, which he described as amicable, was “not part of or relevant to the announcement” of his conversion of his stock. Rather, Mr. Pincus said, he made the decision in consultation with Zynga’s board, partly because of growing criticism of dual- and multiclass share structures. As part of the change, Mr. Pincus said, he will leave Zynga as an employee — he was executive chairman — and become nonexecutive chairman of the company’s board of directors. “We think the company doesn’t benefit anymore from a multiclass structure,” Mr. Pincus said. Dual-class voting structures have been around for decades and have been especially popular at media companies, such as News Corporation and The New York Times Company. Many prominent tech companies have turned to them as well, starting with the initial public offering of Google in 2004. Since then, Facebook, Zynga, Snap and a variety of others have followed suit with similar structures. As a result, shareholder meetings for some of the world’s most valuable companies — including Facebook and Alphabet, the holding company that now owns Google — are mostly for show. Shareholders propose and vote on resolutions even though the founders have the only votes that matter. The vast majority of companies that go public have a single class of stock, where one share equals one vote. About 81 percent of companies that went public last year had single-class arrangements, according to the Council of Institutional Investors, a nonprofit association of pension funds and other large investors. Charles Elson, a corporate governance professor at the University of Delaware, said that in his 20 years of tracking issues around multiclass stock structures, Mr. Pincus was the first public company executive he could recall who voluntarily reduced his voting power so dramatically. “It’s quite an unusual move, but it’s a welcome move,” Mr. Elson said. Multiclass structures are bad for ordinary investors because they make founders unaccountable, he added. “If a C.E.O. does a poor job, he’s not going to fire himself,” he said. “The problems it creates far outweigh any benefits.” Some recent studies, however, have suggested that companies with multiclass structures have outperformed companies with a single stock class. A report last month by the lawyer David Berger and Prof. Laurie Simon Hodrick of Columbia Business School concluded that there are benefits to multiclass structures, including limiting pressure from institutional investors, which own the majority of public shares. The authors said that calls to limit multiclass structures were premature. In response to some of the criticism of multiclass structures, more companies are going public with provisions that automatically convert their shares to a single class after a period of time, anywhere from five to 20 years. Fitbit, the maker of fitness trackers, went public in 2015 with a 12-year provision that sunsets its dual-class stock, while the cloud software company Okta went public last year with a similar 10-year provision. Mr. Pincus said Zynga’s multiclass share structure provided his company with “air cover” during several difficult years after it went public at the end of 2011. The company originally made games that people played on Facebook through desktop web browsers, but its business was upended by the surge of mobile gaming on smartphones. Zynga gradually focused on mobile games, but its stock has languished even as it has mounted a turnaround under a new chief executive, Frank Gibeau. The company’s shares closed at $3.64 on Wednesday, far below the $10 public offering price. Zynga also announced it had swung to a profit of $5.6 million in the first quarter from a loss of $9.5 million a year ago. Mr. Pincus said his voting control at Zynga had not given him veto power over outside offers to acquire the company, though it did give him the ability to replace board members. He said he had never exercised that right. When asked if Zynga could consider acquisition offers more easily now that Mr. Pincus had relinquished most of his voting power, Mr. Gibeau said, “That’s not our mission — our focus is to grow the company.” Mr. Pincus said he intended to devote more time to investing in start-ups. He said he was particularly interested in companies focused on the blockchain, the technology that’s behind electronic currencies like Bitcoin, but could also have broader applications. Giving up his control of Zynga, Mr. Pincus said, will “create more space between me and the company whenever I go launch new products.” Follow Nick Wingfield and Jack Nicas on Twitter: @nickwingfield and @jacknicas.

business,"By Reuters (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday reported resilient iPhone sales in the face of waning global demand and promised $100 billion in additional stock buybacks, reassuring investors that its decade-old smartphone invention had life in it yet. Apple's quarterly results topped Wall Street forecasts, which dropped ahead of the report on growing concern over the iPhone. The Cupertino, California-based company also was more optimistic about the current quarter than most financial analysts, driving shares up 3.6 percent to $175.25 after hours. Suppliers around the globe had warned of smartphone weakness, playing into fears that the company known for popularizing personal computers, tablets and smartphones had become too reliant on the iPhone.  Sales of 52.2 million iPhones against a Wall Street target of 52.3 million was a comfort and up from 50.7 million last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Apple bought $23.5 billion of stock in the March quarter, and said it planned to hike its dividend 16 percent, compared with a 10.5 percent increase last year. Analysts believe the heavy emphasis on buybacks will bolster share prices, but some investors wished Apple had found different uses for the cash.  ""I'd hoped for more on the dividend side or maybe a strategic investment,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. ""I assume Apple can't find a strategic investment at the current prices that will move the needle for them. The $100 billion buyback is good for right now but it's not exactly looking to the future."" The cash Apple earmarked for stock buybacks is about twice the $50 billion market capitalization of electric car maker Tesla Inc. Apple posted revenue for its March quarter of $61.1 billion, up from $52.9 billion last year. Wall Street expected $60.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Average selling prices for iPhones were $728, compared with Wall Street expectations of $742. The figure is up more than 10 percent from $655 a year ago, suggesting Apple's iPhone X, which starts at $999, has helped boost prices. Analysts had feared the high price was muting demand for the iPhone X, but Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was the most popular iPhone model every week in the March quarter. ""This is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular,"" Cook said during the company's earnings call.  ""It's one of those things like when a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points. But it's a Super Bowl winner and that's how we feel about it."" The iPhone X has shaped up to be ""a good, not a great product. There was a time prior to its introduction that investors expected it to be a great product,"" said Thomas Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson Companies.  ""Now that we know it is a good product, as investors have lowered expectations, that is enough, in my view, for shares to go higher from current levels."" Positive iPhone news boosted shares of chip suppliers. Skyworks Solutions Inc rose 2.9 percent, Broadcom Inc was up 2 percent, while Cirrus Logic gained 4.3 percent. Apple also predicted revenue of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion in the June quarter, ahead of the $51.6 billion Wall Street expected as of Monday evening, and the share repurchases in the March quarter drove Apple's cash net of debt down slightly to $145 billion.  ""We are returning the cash to investors as we have promised,"" Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview. Profits were $2.73 per share versus expectations of $2.68 per share, as of Monday, and up from $2.10 a year ago. Apple's services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue compared with expectations of $8.3 billion. Heading into earnings, investors were hopeful that growth in that segment could help offset the cooling global smartphone market. Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester, said Apple's services segment results were positive but warned that Apple needed to continue to boost subscriptions on its platforms, which reached 270 million users in the March quarter and includes people who subscribe to third-party apps on the iPhone as well as Apple's own services like iCloud. ""Apps are carrying most (services revenue) right now, but Apple needs to get to a place where it's mostly subscriptions and monthly fees and not just one-off downloads,"" Ask said. Apple traditionally updates its share buyback and dividend program each spring, and the $100 billion it added this year compares with an increase of $50 billion last year. (Graphic: Apple Buys Back Shares - https://reut.rs/2JIjkgo) In February, Apple said it planned to draw down its excess cash, although Cook had downplayed the possibility of a special dividend. But investors have had concerns around Apple because of brewing trade tensions with China. Greater China sales rose 21 percent from a year earlier, Apple's best growth rate there in 10 quarters, to $13.0 billion. While there has not yet been a tariff on devices such as Apple's iPhone, Cook traveled last week to Washington to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss trade matters.  ""China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins,"" Cook said on the call, when asked about a possible trade war. ""I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently,"" he said.  Apple has been emphasizing its contributions to the U.S. economy in recent months, outlining a $30 billion U.S. spending plan and highlighting the tens of billions of dollars it spends each year with U.S.-based suppliers. In recent months, Apple has been emphasizing the size of its overall user base, which includes used iPhones, rather than focusing strictly on new device sales, a sign of the increasing importance of making money off users without selling them new hardware.

business,"By Reuters (Reuters) - Silver Lake is buying Zoopla and PrimeLocation owner ZPG for 2.2 billion pounds ($3 billion), landing the Daily Mail publishing group a 642 million pound windfall for cashing out of online property portals. Along with rival and market leader Rightmove, ZPG dominates online searches by people looking to buy or rent homes in Britain. Zoopla's sites carry property listings for nearly 15,000 estate agent branches. Residential property transactions across the UK rose by 4.5 percent year-on-year to 1,206,180 in the year to March 2018, seasonally adjusted provisional data https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/700950/UK_Tables_Apr_2018__cir_.pdf from HM Revenue and Customs for those with completion values of 40,000 pounds or more show. Analysts and bankers said on Friday the ZPG sale was likely to be used as a price benchmark for other mergers and acquisitions involving such portals and comparison websites. Launched in 2007 by Alex Chesterman, who was also behind the LoveFilm video-on-demand service acquired by Amazon.com, ZPG was floated in 2014 and its shares have since risen by 69 percent. Under the terms of the agreed deal, each ZPG shareholder will get 490 pence in cash, a premium of 31 percent over Thursday's close, U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake said. Newspaper owner Daily Mail and General Trust, which merged its property portals Findaproperty and PrimeLocation with ZPG in 2012, will receive 642 million pounds for its near 30 percent stake. If the ZPG deal completes, DMGT's returns from online property will total 890 million pounds, more than 14 times the cost of its original investments, it said, after its shares rose more than 9 percent to a 16-month high. Meanwhile, ZPG's second biggest shareholder, hedge fund Lansdowne, declined to comment on whether it supported the bid. Silver Lake, with around $39 billion in assets under management, said ZPG, whose websites and apps attract more than 50 million visits a month, was a great growth technology story. ONLINE INTEREST Shares in ZPG, which also owns utility price comparison website uSwitch, were up about 30 percent to 488 pence at 1420 GMT after ZPG directors said in a joint statement they considered the terms of the deal ""fair and reasonable"". The directors of ZPG, who own 1.16 pct of the firm, also backed the takeover, which Ian Whittaker at Liberum, who has a ""buy"" rating on ZPG, said showed that buyers were prepared to pay ""punchy multiples"" for high quality assets. ""The question now is whether there is a counter-bid. If there is one, we think the most likely candidate is Axel Springer, which has a collection of online property classified assets throughout assets but nothing in the UK."" The deal shows UK consumer-focused online companies are increasingly seen as attractive takeover assets, analysts said.  ZPG itself made a 460-million pound takeover offer for Gocompare.Com Group Plc, which the price comparison website operator rejected in January.  And earlier this year, German publisher Axel Springer made a nearly 125 million pounds investment in British online real estate agent Purplebricks. ""We would not be surprised for more M&A for leading UK digital stocks given that some shares prices have been depressed due to Brexit woes,"" Peel Hunt analyst Jessica Pok said. ZPG was advised by Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and Jefferies, while Lazard advised DMGT on the deal, which needs the backing of the holders of more than 75 percent of the group's shares. ""It's a key pricing benchmark that will be used for other likely M&A in the sector, both for digital classifiers and price comparison websites,"" Philippe Noel, a director in Lazard's TMT team, told Reuters of the deal.

business,"Common Sense By James B. Stewart Among Amazon’s 20 finalist cities for its coveted second headquarters are several that would have to be called long shots: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville and Miami, to name three. And then there’s Indianapolis. In the frenzy of coverage and speculation that accompanied Amazon’s initial announcement of a North America-wide competition for the new headquarters, I couldn’t find anyone who cited Indianapolis as a likely finalist. This week the Irish betting site Paddy Power had Indianapolis tied for last among the finalists, with the odds of being chosen at 20 to 1. (Boston and Atlanta have been vying for the best odds, with Boston on top this week at 2 to 1.) The commercial real estate firm CBRE ranked Indianapolis only 33rd among 50 American cities for what CBRE calls “tech talent.” Amazon has cited access to highly trained and educated technology workers as one of its top priorities. And then there’s what might be called the “cool” factor — which Indianapolis, at first glance, would seem to be lacking. Bob Stutz, chief executive of Salesforce.com’s Marketing Cloud, which is based in Indianapolis, came to the fast-growing company from Microsoft, and lived in Amazon’s hometown, Seattle. When Salesforce asked him to move to Indianapolis, his first thought was, “You’ve got to be kidding.” But if Mr. Stutz’s experience is any indication, the oddsmakers may have to recalculate Indianapolis’s chances. Since moving to the city 16 months ago, Mr. Stutz said, he has been “amazed.” “Indianapolis has done what may be the best urban redevelopment I’ve seen in this country,” he said. “Everyone here is aligned with making Indianapolis a successful place for technology companies. The people are tremendous, very friendly, polite, with a strong work ethic.” With over 1,700 Salesforce employees there, Indianapolis is now home to the company’s second-largest office outside its San Francisco headquarters. In May the company moved into the Salesforce tower in downtown Indianapolis, the tallest building in Indiana, representing a commitment from the company that “we’re here to stay,” Mr. Stutz said. Salesforce is eager to move more employees to Indianapolis because of its much lower costs and a good quality of life. “This is one of the few places where you can buy a beautiful home in the city for under $200,000,” he said. One area where Indianapolis stands out also happens to be one of Amazon’s top priorities, according to its proposal: “A stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure.” Indianapolis may be the most business-friendly city in the country, Mr. Stutz said. Both Indiana’s governor, Eric Holcomb, a Republican, and the city’s mayor, Joe Hogsett, a Democrat, showed up for the opening of the Salesforce tower, and when it comes to promoting business, partisan gridlock is all but unknown in the state. Both officials “were very vocal and hands-on and totally bought into this,” said Michael Huber, chief executive of the Indy Chamber of Commerce, which worked closely with regional and state elected officials, and private sector leaders, to assemble Indianapolis’s Amazon proposal. “That made it so much easier for us.” Neither the city nor the state has said what, if any, tax or other incentives it is offering Amazon. In opening the competition, Amazon also said that “a strong university system is required.” Indianapolis hardly comes to mind as an academic mecca. But it’s the geographic center of “a surprising number of highly rated schools that are a 45-minute to one-hour drive away,” said Mark McCoy, the president of DePauw University, a liberal arts college and music school in Greencastle (a 35-minute drive from the Indianapolis airport, and also my alma mater). These include Big Ten members Indiana University and Purdue University, as well as Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, ranked the nation’s No. 1 undergraduate engineering program by U.S. News & World Report for 19 consecutive years. Many university faculty members live in or around Indianapolis, “attracted to a metropolitan area with great cultural opportunities,” Dr. McCoy said. “Over 5,000 of our DePauw graduates live in Indianapolis. After they graduate, many of them want to stay.” With a population of 855,000 (ranked 15th among United States cities), in a metropolitan area of more than two million, Indianapolis is larger and more diverse than many people realize. The city has a highly regarded symphony, art museum, ballet and school of ballet, and zoo. It’s probably best known as a sports mecca, with the N.B.A. Pacers, W.N.B.A. Fever and N.F.L. Colts. It’s the headquarters for the N.C.A.A. and the site of numerous collegiate sports competitions, and it hosted the 2012 Super Bowl. And, of course, it’s home to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site of the Indianapolis 500 auto race. Mr. Stutz lived in Austin, Tex. (another Amazon finalist), before moving to Seattle, and watched its evolution from sleepy state capital to technology hub and hip cultural magnet. “Austin was never a cool place,” he said. “Now it’s a hotbed of cool. Indianapolis isn’t quite there yet, but I see a lot of similarities.” Last year Bon Appétit magazine devoted a feature to the “Brooklynization of Indy” that focused on the city’s explosion of craft breweries, artisanal bakeries and farm-to-table restaurants. Transportation facilities are also prominent on Amazon’s wish list. The city’s light-filled new international airport has been voted the best in North America for five years running by Airports Council International and the best airport in the United States for four years by readers of Condé Nast Traveler. The airport offers multiple direct flights to Seattle, San Francisco, New York, Boston and Washington, and is about to start nonstop service to Paris. Indianapolis’s central location and network of interstate highways earned the city its nickname, the Crossroads of America. Amazon is among the large companies with distribution centers there. While Indianapolis lacks subways, light rail or a sophisticated urban transport network, the city is crisscrossed with bike and walking trails. Mr. Stutz said many Salesforce employees biked or walked to work (something Amazon’s Seattle employees value). Of the 20 finalist cities, Indianapolis has the least traffic congestion and the lowest average home prices, according to the Chamber of Commerce. That’s not to say there aren’t high-end options: A 21,000-square-foot, six-bedroom 1930s-era mansion, currently home to the Indiana University chancellor, is on the market for just under $7 million. (It might be perfect for the Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos.) For all its virtues, Indianapolis faces a number of hurdles. While Mr. Stutz told me that Salesforce had found an abundance of homegrown tech talent there, Amazon knows it will need to import many of the high-level software engineers and employees who will form the core of the work force at its second headquarters. That may be a challenge. Unlike Amazon’s home state of Washington, Indiana reliably votes Republican in presidential elections, though it went for Barack Obama over John McCain in 2008. Donald J. Trump carried the state overwhelmingly in 2016, and Mike Pence, an Indiana native and self-described religious conservative, served as Indiana’s governor before becoming Mr. Trump’s vice president. A strong streak of social conservatism runs through the state (though not so much in Indianapolis), and this week the state legislature was roiled by a new round in the culture wars as legislators debated whether to pass a hate-crimes bill to protect victims of bias based on race, religion, sex, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. Indiana is one of only five states without such legislation. Partly as a result of pressure from Salesforce, other companies and the N.C.A.A., Mr. Pence, when he was governor, amended a so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 2015 that had allowed business owners to discriminate against gays and lesbians on the grounds of religious principle. Mr. Huber said the Chamber of Commerce had been a longtime supporter of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and was a strong supporter of comprehensive anti-hate-crime legislation. The city has had a comprehensive human rights ordinance in place since 2005, he said. Indianapolis may never emerge as the popular favorite to win, but I wouldn’t count it out. Maureen Krauss, the chamber’s chief economic development officer, who worked on Indianapolis’s proposal, said a team of about 300 people had contributed to the first-round effort, and they worked 43 days straight. “We finished it two days early,” she said. “Amazon is a creative company and a tech company, and that’s the kind of proposal we tried to deliver.” She and Mr. Huber got the good news that Indianapolis was a finalist on Thursday last week, but there was no celebration. “We hunkered down and started on Phase 2,” Mr. Huber said.

business,"Common Sense By James B. Stewart When it comes to antitrust enforcement, one of the guiding principles is the effect on consumer prices. So the antitrust question of the moment is this: Will combining AT&T with Time Warner or Sprint with T-Mobile so diminish competition that prices go up? While regulators and a federal judge ponder that question, the great disrupter — Amazon — is already raising prices. Last week, it said its Amazon Prime service, which includes its extensive video offerings along with free shipping and other benefits, would cost $119, a 20 percent increase from the current $99. To justify the move, Amazon cited higher costs and the fact that it’s only the second increase since it introduced its Prime service, for $79, in 2005. Still, Amazon’s move suggests a degree of pricing power that its anxious rivals can only envy. Amazon said it now had over 100 million Prime customers, and its first-quarter profit, announced last week, jumped more than 120 percent, sending its stock price soaring. Netflix, too, has been raising prices, doing so most recently in October. As the seemingly unstoppable Amazon juggernaut rolls on, there’s no doubt that media and telecommunications markets are converging and undergoing radical transformation. AT&T wants to combine its distribution channels with Time Warner’s content creation, a transaction known as vertical integration because the two companies aren’t direct competitors. While antitrust challenges to vertical combinations have been rare, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger on grounds that the combined companies might threaten to withhold Time Warner content to extract higher prices from rival distributors (a claim the companies have dismissed as economic nonsense). But Amazon is already vertically integrated — it creates content and distributes it over the internet. So are Netflix, Google (with YouTube) and Facebook (with its Watch feature and other offerings). Which is why the so-called FANG companies (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) loomed large at the just-completed AT&T-Time Warner trial and may well figure in a Sprint-T-Mobile decision, even though none of the technology giants is directly involved or is a party to the litigation. AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, repeatedly referred to the technology giants during the trial, and made clear that they are what drove the merger. “The media and entertainment industry is going through some rather significant disruption,” he testified. “It’s coming from predominately folks in the tech sector.” The Time Warner chief executive, Jeff Bewkes, made the same argument. “They have the content, the programming, and they have the technological capability of delivering it straight to you,” he said, adding that by “they” he meant the FANGs. “And they can communicate with you about that relationship and what to watch and how to value the program.” In closing arguments this week, AT&T and Time Warner’s lead trial lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, argued that a combined company could use the kind of data about its users that is routinely collected by the tech companies to enhance its programming and offer more targeted advertising. It could use the resulting higher revenues to reduce consumer prices by what he estimated to be $500 million per year. The government’s lead lawyer, Craig Conrath, provided a counterargument: “The fact that AT&T may want to compete in some other market, that doesn’t give them a free pass to reduce competition in the pay-TV market,” he said. (The pay-TV market has traditionally included subscription TV providers, including cable and satellite, but not over-the-internet providers like Amazon and Netflix.) AT&T sees Netflix, YouTube and Amazon as “the wolves at the door,” said Scott Hemphill, an antitrust expert at the New York University School of Law. “That’s the center of their theory.” Time Warner’s content companies, like HBO, CNN and the Turner channels, “are just islands of content unmoored from the consumer,” he said. Of course, the argument can be made that AT&T doesn’t need to buy a company like Time Warner — it could create a media content company of its own. That’s what Amazon and Netflix did, and both companies now outspend Time Warner on original programming. But from a consumer standpoint, it doesn’t really matter. “The major tech platforms are becoming vertically integrated as they create their own content to push out over their distribution platforms,” Rich Greenfield of the investment firm BTIG wrote in a recent research note. “In turn, is it O.K. to be vertically integrated if you build your way in, but not to buy your way into it? What if instead of an acquisition of Time Warner, AT&T just spent $8 billion a year on content creation, the way Netflix is — would that be legal, but buying Time Warner is not?” Whether the FANG companies compete in the same markets with AT&T and Time Warner is of more than academic interest — it could well influence Judge Richard Leon’s decision, which he said he would deliver no later than June 12. If Judge Leon does take such an expanded view of the market, AT&T and Time Warner would most likely prevail. Even if he does find some violations, he could impose conditions on the merger rather than block it entirely, much as Comcast had to accept conditions on its purchase of NBC Universal. Making a case that the proposed Sprint-T-Mobile merger would benefit consumers is far more difficult. The deal has drawn near-unanimous opposition from antitrust experts. The Sprint-T-Mobile tie-up, in contrast to AT&T-Time Warner, would be a horizontal merger — a combination of direct competitors, that way reducing the number of players operating in the market. Those kinds of deals have traditionally received more antitrust scrutiny. The government rejected the same merger less than four years ago, and the result was robust competition and lower prices for wireless services — exactly what antitrust regulators fervently hope for. Before that, in 2011, the government blocked a proposed merger of AT&T and T-Mobile. So the question is whether the markets in which they compete have so changed since then that a merger now wouldn’t harm consumers. The two companies will need to argue that the market is no longer just the four wireless providers, but now includes the technology giants and broadband and cable companies like Comcast. A merged Sprint and T-Mobile would command only a small share of such a vastly expanded market, and wouldn’t have the power to raise prices. That may arguably be the case for video, which can now be streamed over wireless handsets, but not for voice calls and texting, at least not yet. Sprint and T-Mobile are talking up the potential for 5G technology to further blur the lines between traditional markets, but widespread use of 5G is still years in the future. Courts and antitrust regulators “don’t usually consider merger defenses that depend on the existence of undeployed technology,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, an antitrust professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and the Wharton School. “Our crystal balls aren’t that good. We don’t have the power to gaze five years down the road, especially when it comes to fast-changing technology.” While Professor Hovenkamp said he understood the argument AT&T and Time Warner were making about Amazon, “this whole generic idea that companies need to merge to go up against Amazon may play to a general audience, but if you take it to its logical conclusion, it could be used to validate nearly every merger.” Perhaps T-Mobile and Sprint could hold off a few years, and return with evidence that they’re actually competing with the big tech companies rather than merely anticipating that competition. Then again, given the vagaries of the Trump administration’s antitrust policies, “they may feel there’s no reason not to roll the dice now,” Mr. Hovenkamp said.

business,"By Reuters SAN FRANCISCO — Ducking analysts' questions has a price: $2 billion. Tesla Inc investors gave a rare rebuke to iconoclastic Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday after he cut off analysts asking about profit potential, sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track. Tesla's future depends on the Model 3 and the company said that it had largely overcome production bottlenecks, with Musk vowing a dramatic turnaround that would reverse losses and generate positive cash flow in just a few months.  Musk plans to shut down its Fremont, California factory for 10 days in the second quarter but said Tesla will meet the production target of 5,000 Model 3s per day by the end of June, as planned, and will turn a profit in the second half of the year.  To achieve profitability, Musk will have to reverse what today amounts to a $22,584 pre-tax loss per vehicle built by the Silicon Valley company. Tesla posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss when it announced first-quarter results on Wednesday. Tesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call, when Musk began cutting analysts' questions short, costing Tesla over $2 billion in market capitalization.  ""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars, an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles. Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off.  He then took several questions in a row about plans for a self-driving car network and other long-term projects from the host of a YouTube channel focused on investing, praising the questions as not boring.  (For a graphic on Tesla earnings click http://tmsnrt.rs/2p6EbiR) 5,000 MODEL 3s PER WEEK Musk's ability to run Tesla is crucial as the company strives to efficiently and profitably build its first vehicle intended to be produced at high volume, the Model 3. Musk acknowledged error recently in over-automating the Model 3 assembly-line, which has resulted in production delays, but it is still unclear how long and costly it will be to unwind this mistake. Delayed Model 3 production also comes as a slew of competitors bring new electric vehicle models to market.  The company stood by a previously announced target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June. Tesla's capital expenditures declined in the quarter and the company cut its spending forecasts for 2018, saying it would spend less than $3 billion. Tesla spent $3.4 billion in 2017. (https://bit.ly/2jn15SB)  Investing.com analyst Clement Thibault said the reduction was noteworthy, ""but in the long run given challenges that lay ahead of Tesla, I don't think it is going to make or break the company."" Tesla ""is definitely not in a minimizing cost stage,"" Thibault said.  Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business. Analysts had not expected so much spending, predicting hundreds of millions of dollars less in so-called cash burn, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tesla did not break out a cash flow calculation that it had included in previous quarters. The niche carmaker, which two years ago vowed to build 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018, has attracted legions of fans for its advanced technology and design. But the company rushed its Model 3 to market, making mistakes in manufacturing whose effects are now being felt, and investor skepticism has risen. Questions over Tesla's finances are top of mind, and many analysts anticipate a capital raise in 2018 despite Musk's statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters.  Tesla said gross margins on the Model 3, which today are slightly negative, would be close to flat in the second quarter and grow to ""highly positive"" in the second half of the year. Tesla said it produced 2,270 Model 3s per week in the last week of April. It said net reservations for the Model 3, including configured orders not yet delivered, exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter. Automotive revenue rose only 1 percent from the prior quarter to $2.74 billion. RECORD LOSS Tesla reported a record loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $330.3 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Tesla had a loss of $3.35 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of $3.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash after spending $655.7 million in quarterly capital expenses. The lack of Model 3 revenue has exacerbated Tesla's cash burn as the company continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on multiple projects in the pipeline, such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory. The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla, which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months.

business,"Op-Ed Contributors By Richard Holden and Anup Malani The extraordinary rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led many people to worry that this market is a giant bubble. Many, including the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, have warned about a “Bitcoin bust” that could rival the dot-com crash of 2000 and wipe out speculators. But the bigger concern about cryptocurrencies may be the damage they could do, in the long run, to government finances through lost tax revenue. The core technology underlying cryptocurrencies, known as blockchain, is premised on anonymity: Transactions are public but linked only to an electronic address. This is a big part of what makes blockchain attractive. But anonymity is also the main fuel for the underground economy, which is now conducted largely via cash. The underground economy is a significant source of lost tax revenue. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it loses around $500 billion annually because of unreported wages alone. And the underground economy in the United States — estimated at 8.4 percent of output — is relatively small compared with those of other countries. If cryptocurrencies were to replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange, they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash. There is no need to visit an A.T.M., and you can securely pay people regardless of their location. No wonder Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become “the next Swiss bank account.” The I.R.S. understands this, which is why it has been pushing to break the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. In November, it persuaded a federal judge to order Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin exchange, to reveal the identity of the customers for more than 14,000 accounts (representing nearly nine million transactions). Blockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the I.R.S. to tax cryptocurrency trading profits. Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the I.R.S. to prove: Suppose A, B and C are electronic addresses you own. You let the I.R.S. know you own A, but not B and C. You buy one Bitcoin at $15,000 and park it at A, expecting the price to go up. Just a few hours later, when a Bitcoin is worth $15,500, you send that Bitcoin to B and then to C. A few months later, when your Bitcoin is now worth $25,000, you send it from C to A and tell the I.R.S., “I sold a Bitcoin to an anonymous counterparty at B back at $15,500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for $25,000.” As a result, you owe taxes on capital gains of just $500 rather than $10,000. The I.R.S. can observe all the transactions between A, B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it cannot disprove that B and C are “arm’s length” counterparties (that is, independent and not colluding). Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem, because as far as the I.R.S. knows, B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rules. It is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits. The only question is how heavy-handed the response would be. One approach would be for the government to accept the difficulty of directly taxing cryptocurrency transactions and to offset the revenue losses by raising tax rates. The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate, so this response would transform revenue losses into a lower gross domestic product. More likely, the United States would take a tougher approach and attempt to ban cryptocurrencies. This solution throws the baby out with the bath water. While cryptocurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations, they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions, especially for the poor, and less reliance on banks, which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve to control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runs. A smarter response would be for the government to switch from taxing income when it is received to taxing income when it is spent. Many economists support moving to this kind of consumption tax, but it would require a major overhaul of the tax code. The prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government; it is also a problem for the cryptocurrencies themselves. For cryptocurrencies to survive long enough to be an effective means of performing everyday transactions, the cryptocurrency community will need to find a way to prevent tax evasion. This will involve a tricky balancing act, preserving anonymity while providing the I.R.S. with sufficient information to prevent tax evasion. More generally, cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn to trust government. Since this goes against the very ethos of the cryptocurrency movement, it poses the most difficult — but no less necessary — challenge.

business,"A look at our latest featured couples.  By Rosalie R. Radomsky In 2013 when Sally Corbette Newman, who does acroyoga (yoga plus acrobatics) and circus arts on the side, heard her friend was about to host Romain Philippe Guimard, a bona fide French acrobat, through Couchsurfing.com, she persuaded her friend to let him stay with her instead. “You don’t get a ton of opportunities to host a professional circus performer,” said Ms. Newman, who had been dazzled by his circus troupe at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston. “It’s a contemporary circus, not big-top Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey stuff,” she said. “It’s a lot more muted, a lot more modern. It’s a magical spectacle.” She took a break from work that afternoon to screen him over coffee at Normandy Farm Artisan Bakery in downtown Charleston, and after they managed to connect and communicate, despite the fact she spoke little French and he little English, she handed over the keys. “It was very natural with Sally,” said Mr. Guimard, who took in local sights on his own by day, and spent evenings with her.

business,"Common Sense By James B. Stewart Elaine Wynn, known as the Queen of Las Vegas for her long involvement with Mirage and Wynn Resorts, the casino and resort companies she founded with her ex-husband Steve Wynn, might seem an unlikely champion of shareholder rights and good corporate governance. She’s better known as a philanthropist (school reform, performing arts), an art collector (she paid $142 million for Francis Bacon’s triptych “Three Studies of Lucian Freud,” and she is co-chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art) and a stickler for standards at the company’s high-end resorts. “To be honest, I’d rather be designing hotel rooms,” she told me this week from her apartment a few blocks from the Wynn Las Vegas, the hotel she called home before being exiled by her ex-husband (she also has homes in Sun Valley, Beverly Hills and Manhattan). Instead, she has had a crash course in corporate law and is working the phones to reach major Wynn shareholders, drumming up support to oust a long-serving board member who’s up for re-election at the annual meeting next week. The outcome is of far more than academic interest, given that Ms. Wynn is now the company’s largest shareholder, with a 9 percent stake valued this week at nearly $2 billion. For years, the terms of a shareholder agreement related to her 2010 divorce settlement prevented her from voting her shares independently of Mr. Wynn. But that changed earlier this year after The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Wynn had engaged in a long pattern of sexual harassment of Wynn employees, and had paid a manicurist $7.5 million after she told others in 2005 that Mr. Wynn had forced her to have sex. Mr. Wynn denied the allegations and called them “preposterous.” But in the aftermath of the article, he agreed to pay Elaine Wynn $25 million and let her vote her shares to settle a yearslong lawsuit she’d filed to overturn the shareholder agreement. Mr. Wynn also resigned as chief executive and sold his 12 percent stake in the company, one in a continuing series of executives of major companies to be swept out in the midst of the #MeToo movement. Even though Mr. Wynn is gone, Ms. Wynn worries that his cronies still run the company and have too many board seats. The board chairman, D. Boone Wayson, has been a friend of Mr. Wynn’s since childhood. The current chief executive, Matt Maddox, was in Mr. Wynn’s wedding party for his 2011 marriage to Andrea Hissom. A number of board members have vacation homes close to Mr. Wynn’s in Sun Valley, Idaho, and have vacationed on Mr. Wynn’s yacht. They include Ms. Wynn’s current target, John J. Hagenbuch, a board member who has also been on the committee that routinely approved Mr. Wynn’s outsized compensation: $28.2 million in 2016. He’s also a member of the board committee investigating the allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Wynn. “This is the only megaphone I have,” Ms. Wynn told me, referring to the proxy fight. “It’s the only way I can send a signal to the board and the investor community that the largest shareholder wants changes made.” She said that she’s not seeking a board seat herself, or the right to name any board members. She’s not opposing two other board nominees of more recent vintage who aren’t old friends of Mr. Wynn. “My mission is to resurrect the integrity of this extraordinary company that is really the capstone of my professional life,” she said. “I could just quietly sell my shares and go off into the sunset and pursue philanthropy. But my mantra is, it’s not where you start in life, it’s where you end up. And I’m not about to go off and leave this company that I helped build as tarnished as it has become.” The company opposes Ms. Wynn’s effort to remove Mr. Hagenbuch, and has repeatedly dismissed her efforts as those of a disgruntled “ex-wife,” a phrase that irritates Ms. Wynn, who is a co-founder and was on the board for years. The company has alleged that she is acting out of personal animosity stemming from her bitter divorce. No matter what her motives, the company may be underestimating Ms. Wynn’s campaign. All three major proxy advisory services — Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis and Egan-Jones — have endorsed her effort to replace Mr. Hagenbuch. As Egan-Jones put it: “We believe that the mere presence of Jay Hagenbuch in the board presents a strong conflict of interest, given that he has close ties with Mr. Wynn. Mr. Hagenbuch, as a member of the special committee that investigates the misconduct of Mr. Wynn, makes the credibility of the whole probe in question. As such, the reputation of the company and the board is also compromised.” The firm also faulted Mr. Hagenbuch’s role on the compensation committee. Glass Lewis said, “Missteps include appointing a personal friend of Mr. Wynn to a special committee charged with reviewing accusations against him, as well as publication of an awkwardly fawning press release regarding Mr. Wynn’s resignation which shows no recognition of the gravity or severity of the claims against him.” Wynn Resorts has drawn the scrutiny and criticism of corporate governance experts for years. Since the company went public in 2002, Mr. Wynn effectively controlled it by voting his and his wife’s combined 21 percent share and naming directors. As is the case in many public companies controlled by the founder and chief executive, there was little board dissent. Ms. Wynn had influence outside the boardroom, but once the couple became estranged (they were divorced, remarried and divorced again), her objections were routinely silenced, she said. After Ms. Wynn asked a question in one boardroom exchange, Mr. Wynn slammed his first on the table and yelled, “No more stupid questions,” Ms. Wynn recalled. She was forced off the board in 2015 and lost a subsequent proxy contest to be reinstated. “That’s always a problem when you have a controlling shareholder,” said Charles Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “If directors disagree they risk being replaced.” It’s also no surprise that in such a culture, no one was willing to blow the whistle on what appears to have been increasingly brazen sexual misconduct by Mr. Wynn. Ms. Wynn has testified  that she learned about the $7.5 million settlement with the manicurist and reported it to Kimmarie Sinatra, the company’s general counsel and corporate secretary, in 2009. After consulting with lawyers, Ms. Sinatra told her the issue had been successfully “handled personally” and wasn’t a company concern, Ms. Wynn testified. She acknowledged in testimony that she did not tell any of her fellow board members. The company has disputed Ms. Wynn’s account, but didn’t call any witnesses to offer its version. The Journal’s coverage portrayed a culture in which many Wynn employees covered up for Mr. Wynn and denigrated women who tried to register complaints. “That would be a toxic cocktail for any company,” Mr. Elson said, “but especially one with such serious governance issues. It’s a combination of a family fight, which is always unpleasant, and a hot-button political issue, sexual harassment. “In this environment, the optics matter. You can’t have Wynn’s friends investigating the allegations. Elaine is absolutely right that the board needs to be refreshed and the legacy directors should go.” The proxy advisory services did credit Wynn Resorts for moving swiftly to distance itself from its founder and to appoint three new directors, all women, with no ties to the scandal. But the company continues to back Mr. Hagenbuch, arguing that he has valuable experience and, in supporting Ms. Wynn, Institutional Shareholders has “placed symbolism over pragmatism.” Ms. Sinatra, who remains as Wynn’s general counsel, told me this week that, all things considered, Wynn Resorts has made “amazing progress” in its abrupt transition from a founder-led company to “a more typical global public company.” She noted that with the addition of three new female directors, 40 percent of the company’s board members will be women. “That has nothing to do with Elaine, but with the board’s attending to longstanding issues of corporate governance that are common at founder-led companies,” she said. Ms. Wynn said she wants to get through next week’s vote and annual meeting, and then “we’ll see about the next steps.” “I’d really like go back to playing with my grandchildren,” she said, “knowing that this tremendous company has good leadership and that my shares will continue to have value.”     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
business,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin MARCH 29, 2018
 Good Thursday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Why Trump might have trouble reining in Amazon. • Public pension fund wants changes to Facebook’s board. • Trump tweets Amazon does not pay enough taxes. • Another FANG stock took a tumble. • The Trump administration wants to further thwart sensitive Chinese investments. The DealBook newsletter is taking a break for Good Friday. We’ll be back with you on Monday. Sign up for it here. 
            I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!         Amazon hasn’t responded to President Trump’s latest tweet about the company, and most likely won’t. Advertisement Mr. Trump’s criticisms, though, are largely mistaken. For a long time, Amazon did not pay state sales tax, but it does so now when it sells its own goods in states that collect it. It is the case, however, that in most states Amazon does not collect sales taxes on goods sold by third parties through its platform. As for the United States Postal Service, Amazon’s business appears to be giving a welcome lift to its package shipping revenue. Advertisement Still, Amazon cannot quietly hope that such criticism just fades away. Amazon’s rapid growth, immense bargaining power, eye-catching initiatives and estimated 44 percent share of U.S. e-commerce sales make the company vulnerable to accusations that it is too powerful. But if the Trump administration pursues ways to curtail the company, it would meet sizable obstacles. Amazon accounts for only 4 percent of all retail sales in the United States, a recent survey estimated. Its revenue is a third of Walmart’s and, even after its acquisition of Whole Foods, Amazon’s footing in the grocery business is still small. All in all, it would be hard to show that Amazon is pushing prices higher for consumers. Amazon also has a loyal customer base — it has an estimated 90 million Prime members — and the public views it relatively favorably. When the Department of Justice’s antitrust lawyers went after the proposed merger of Time Warner and AT&T, it was not targeting companies that were particularly popular with the public. Still, some Amazon critics see a possible, though small, opening. In theory, an antitrust case could focus on the firms that supply Amazon with goods, according to Christopher L. Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland State University. If a company consistently uses its power to demand a good from suppliers at too low a price, the public could still get hurt. That’s because the supply of the good could decline, its quality degrade, and there may be less innovation in the sector that produces the good, Mr. Sagers said. But anyone bringing that against Amazon would have to explain why Walmart would not be a target, too. — Peter Eavis The investment adviser to New York City’s pension funds is calling for changes to Facebook’s board to address the fallout from Cambridge Analytica’s improper harvesting of information from 50 million users of the social network. Advertisement New York City’s comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, wrote in a letter addressed to Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, an independent director at Facebook and the chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: “Facebook is now among the most valuable and, given the immense power and reach of its platform, most influential companies in the world. The very data collection and sharing practices that made its extraordinary growth possible, and that are the basis of the company’s business model, are now facing potential regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world.” New York City’s pension funds, which have more than $193 billion in assets under management, own $895 million of Facebook’s shares, according to the letter. Even with the recent tumble in its shares, Facebook is valued at more than $450 billion. In his letter, Mr. Stringer calls on Facebook’s independent directors to take four steps to help restore investor confidence. Here are the proposed changes: 1) Add at least three new independent directors to improve the board’s ability to oversee the evolving risks Facebook faces. 2) Name an independent director as chairman, allowing Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive and chairman, to focus on running the company. 3) Create a committee of independent directors to oversee the company’s data privacy policies and risks. 4) Institute a clawback policy so that the board can “recoup executive pay in the event of violations of law, regulation or company policy.” President Trump spoke out against Amazon on Thursday, saying that the online behemoth does not pay enough taxes and uses the United States postal system “as their Delivery Boy.” 
            I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!         The president’s commentary, made in a Twitter post, comes amid reports that Mr. Trump has expressed an interest in reining in the e-commerce business. Advertisement Amazon and the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos, are among Mr. Trump’s regular Twitter targets. In December, Mr. Trump questioned whether the United States Post Office charges Amazon enough for package deliveries. And in August, Mr. Trump said Amazon hurts taxpaying businesses. Amazon, however, does pay taxes — $412 million in 2016, for instance, according to the company’s report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Axios reported on Wednesday that Mr. Trump has wondered aloud whether Amazon could be vulnerable to antitrust or competition laws. “Trump’s wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him — and he agrees — that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.” Amazon shares fell more than 7 percent following that Axios article but recovered some of those losses after a White House official told Reuters that the company faced no particular policy changes. But the administration is always looking at its options, the official added. The stock closed down 4.4 percent Wednesday. Shares were down nearly 2 percent in early trading. Should shareholders worry? The GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Bloomberg that this regulatory threat was unlikely to change Amazon’s business model, but it was still “the last thing nervous tech investors wanted to see today.” Retailers, at least, already have some reason to be cheerful. And Amazon has another target market for expansion: housekeeping. Corporate American will start reporting first-quarter results in less than two weeks, and earnings are expected to be big. Analysts estimate that profits at companies in the S.&P. 500 grew 17.3 percent this quarter, according to FactSet. If the forecasts prove accurate that would be highest earnings growth rate since the first quarter of 2011. Advertisement Perhaps most surprising, is that analysts have grown more optimistic on corporate earnings as the quarter progressed. The earnings forecast for the index rose 5.4 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. Typically, analysts lower their expectations as the quarter progresses. On average, the profit estimates for the index fall 3.7 percent from the start of the quarter to the end. But there are reasons for investors to temper their enthusiasm. Analysts have not been as optimistic about the abilities of companies to increase sales. Revenue is expected to have grown 7.3 percent in the first quarter, up from a 7 percent rate at the start of the quarter. That suggests analysts are not raising estimates because of increased sales. So why are they? Taxes. And the impact tax reform will have on bottom lines should moderate in the coming quarters. That may already be happening. BofA Merrill Lynch’s earnings revision ratio for the S.&P. 500 fell in March for the first time in three months. Of course, the pullback comes after the ratio hits the highest level on record in February, but it does suggest that earnings lift from tax reform has begun to wane. Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into their shares with abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of that rally are being tested. Exhibit A: Facebook, down 20 percent from its recent high. Exhibit B: Nvidia, off 12 percent from its recent high. Exhibit C: Tesla, not a tech stock but in the FANG+ index. Concerns about Tesla’s ability to fund itself can also be seen in the trading of its debt. The WSJ’s Charley Grant explains: Tesla can’t simply cut spending to solve its cash challenge if it hopes to ramp up production. The company has racked up about $10 billion in long-term debt and has $23 billion in total liabilities. To survive long term, Tesla needs to stop overpromising and to scale back its ambitions to goals it actually can achieve. Right now, though, it just needs more money. Peter Eavis notes that the latest problems for tech giants have raised deeper doubts: After the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth. And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread. Barclays said on Thursday that it agreed to pay $2 billion to settle a lawsuit by United States authorities that accused the British bank of fraudulently misleading the public in the sale of tens of billions of dollars in securities backed by home mortgages. Advertisement The Justice Department sued the bank in December 2016 after the two sides failed to reach a settlement despite months of talks. The settlement is the latest by a European lender related to residential mortgage-backed securities sold ahead of the financial crisis and follows agreements reached by Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank in late 2016. “I am pleased that we have been able to reach a fair and proportionate settlement with the Department of Justice,” James E. Staley, the Barclays chief executive, said in a news release. “It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible.” Two former Barclays executives who were sued along with the bank also have reached settlements, agreeing to pay a combined $2 million, the Justice Department said in a news release. Their lawyers separately said the government’s claims were baseless and each agreed to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing. - Chad Bray Tammy Kiely is leaving Goldman Sachs to join Morgan Stanley as global head of semiconductor and auto technology investment banking, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.

President Trump has been criticizing Amazon over the past week, and on Thursday he suggested — inaccurately — that the company is ripping off the United States Postal Service. Jimmy Kimmel was dumbfounded by the criticism, and Jimmy Fallon took the opportunity to poke fun at Trump. “But why insult the people at the post office by calling them Amazon’s delivery boys? They deliver things — that’s what they do! It doesn’t make them boys. They’re adults!” — JIMMY KIMMEL “President Trump has been sending angry tweets about Amazon for the way they run their business. Then someone handed Trump some bubble wrap from an Amazon box and he forgot all about it.” — JIMMY FALLON “After Trump attacked Amazon on Twitter, their stock fell by 5 percent. It’s all part of Trump’s plan to get Amazon’s stock to match his approval rating.” — JIMMY FALLON “This is when I appreciate Twitter: It used to be, if you wanted to hear a 71-year-old man whining about the post office, you had to go to the post office.” — SETH MEYERS Dwayne Johnson sat down with Kimmel on Tuesday, 48 hours after April Fools’ Day, but he still found a way to play a prank on the host. He told Kimmel with seeming sincerity that his girlfriend had played an April Fools’ joke on him, pretending to go into labor and nearly letting him take her to the hospital before she revealed the joke. (All of that turned out to be completely made up.) “Six of Trump’s cabinet members have been questioned about improper spending. Trump was shocked. He said, ‘I still have six cabinet members? How’s that possible?’” — JIMMY FALLON “You know, the police grease the poles specifically so people won’t climb them, and then they do anyway. It never works. If I was in charge, instead of grease, I’d use Krazy Glue. You want to climb that pole? You’re going to be up there for a while.” — JIMMY KIMMEL, on the Philadelphia police’s response to Villanova’s win in the college basketball championship game on Monday A perfectly reasonable — that is, nonsensical — debate on “Late Night” turned into a set-destroying stunt sequence. All parties seemed pleased. Trump’s team wants to take its legal battle with Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic-film actress known as Stormy Daniels, into private arbitration. Kimmel thinks “private arbitration” sounds like the name of a porn film. Mike Myers appears in “Terminal,” a new comic thriller. His part isn’t big, but it’s his first live-action film role since 2009. He will talk to Fallon on Wednesday night. Cardi B, the rapper, whose interview with Fallon in January became a viral smash, will co-host “The Tonight Show” with him on Monday. It’ll be the first time the show has officially had a co-host.

business,"By Reuters LONDON — Codenamed ""Project Solar"", Sainsbury's 7.3 billion-pound deal with rival British supermarket chain Asda is an alignment of planets years in the making. In order to keep it secret, Asda, owned by U.S. giant Walmart, was dubbed ""Mars"" and Sainsbury's ""Jupiter"" by the teams working on the takeover, a source with direct knowledge of the talks said. The coming together of the two was eventually sealed by a group of retailing executives who have been crossing orbits as both rivals and colleagues for decades.  Indeed, Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe and Roger Burnley, the CEO of Asda, have a shared history that will aid with the integration of the two cultures, Walmart International chief Judith McKenna said on Monday.  Coupe, 57, will lead the combined business, while Burnley, 51, will continue to run Asda, which will keep its brand. The two are friends and Burnley became Asda's chief executive in January knowing that a deal with Coupe was on the cards. ""Mike and Roger's ability to work together from a previous life is really helpful,"" McKenna, an Asda veteran who worked with Coupe at the supermarket group in the 1990s, said.  Coupe, who grew up in West Sussex and enjoys playing the guitar and cycling, was a graduate trainee at consumer goods giant Unilever who then moved to Tesco's marketing department before joining Asda in 1993. He became its trading director before departing in 2001, following Walmart's 6.7 billion pound takeover of the British supermarket company in 1999.  After 18 months running frozen food business Iceland, Coupe went to Sainsbury's, becoming its trading director in 2004 and succeeding Justin King as its CEO 10 years later. Meanwhile, Yorkshireman Burnley started as a graduate at DIY chain B&Q before joining Asda as its supply director in 1996, while Coupe was there, and then taking a key role in the Walmart integration. In 2002 he was poached by Matalan to become the discount retailer's supply chain director, before reuniting with Coupe at Sainsbury's four years later.  Burnley spent a decade at Sainsbury's, rising to become its retail and operations director and working closely with Coupe, only to return to Asda as its chief operating officer in 2016. Like Coupe, Burnley is a keen cyclist, and also enjoys sailing, snowboarding and running in his spare time. However, despite the friendship between the pair, the tie-up between Britain's second- and third-largest food retailers stems from talks that Coupe held with David Cheesewright, McKenna's predecessor who retired as CEO of the U.S. firm's overseas arm, Walmart International, in January.  ""We've been talking to each other for a while,"" Coupe said. ""It goes back to some conversations that Dave Cheesewright and I had quite a period of time ago, but things really got going this time last year.""   That was after rival supermarket giant Tesco agreed a 4 billion-pound takeover of wholesaler Booker in January 2017 in a bid to strengthen its grip on Britain's food retailing market.  If the acquisition of Asda is cleared by regulators, it is expected to result in Sainsbury's leapfrogging Tesco to become the UK's largest supermarket operator by market share. It is Coupe's second deal, following Sainsbury's 2016 purchase of Argos. As long-time brokers to the company, advisers from UBS and Morgan Stanley worked with Sainsbury's on the Asda deal as well as the earlier Argos acquisition. Walmart is being advised by Rothschild and Credit Suisse.   (Reporting by Ben Martin; Editing by Alexander Smith) Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
business,"Stromae returns, the Walmart yodeling kid gets his shot and the other tracks that caught our critics’ attention this week. By Jon Pareles, Jon Caramanica and Giovanni Russonello Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week’s most notable new songs and videos — and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, Oneohtrix Point Never’s peculiar pop, a song from the Walmart child yodeler and the start of a new era for the production duo Stargate. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage. Willie Nelson, 84, matter-of-factly marvels at his own longevity in “Last Man Standing,” the title track of his new album. “It’s gettin’ hard to watch my pals check out,” he sings, and lists members of his musical generation who are now gone. But the music is no dirge; it’s a sly, New Orleans-tinged mambo full of improvisational byplay, a swinging life force. JON PARELES For Oneohtrix Point Never — the prolific, adventurous and sometimes bewildering electronic composer Daniel Lopatin — “Black Snow” is fairly close to pop. It’s built around a (computer-tuned) lead vocal over a finger-snap beat and a recurring bass line, with melodic verses and a refrain: “a wave of black snow.” As pop, though, it’s seriously peculiar, with dystopian lyrics and dissonant interludes from sources like a daxophone, a bowed electronic instrument invented by Hans Reichel. The video clip, directed by Mr. Lopatin, brings a fanged mutant and perky line dancers to a toxic waste dump — where else? J.P. Only a month or so has passed since the Walmart child yodeler went viral. His appearance at Coachella a couple of weeks ago portended more to come, but even by the warp-speed standards of modern online celebrity, this is quite a lot, and fast. “Famous” is an eminently serviceable pop-country song in the gentleman mode from someone actually wearing a bow tie (and reading the lyrics off a sheet of paper, judging by the video). The conceit of the song is that Mr. Ramsey would rather be known for the quality of his love than the quality of his voice, which is undeniably sweet and not at all awkward to hear an 11-year-old muse about. JON CARAMANICA The punch-drunk frustration here comes first as an ambiguous lament, then a clear renunciation of — who else — the president. Marc Ribot, a downtown guitarist of freewheeling insouciance, handles the yelping vocals himself: “We never wanted a swear-in accident/We hate the ground you walk on, and all the rest of this cheap suburban sentiment/Why are you still here?” In the track’s second half things pick up, with Mr. Ribot overdubbing three guitars (at least?), conjuring a brew of alienation and riled-up nerves. The drummer Ches Smith and the bassist Shahzad Ismaily dip and dot underneath him, as if trying to stay cool under extreme pressure. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO The Belgian songwriter, singer, rapper, dancer, videomaker and fashionista Stromae, whose 2013 album, “Racine Carreé” (“Square Root”) conquered Europe, has re-emerged after five years between new songs of his own. The nine-minute “Défiler” (“Unwinding”) is the soundtrack to the runway show for a collection by the Belgian company Mosaert. Yet the song itself glumly notes the inexorability of time — “We watch as it unwinds, the thread of our lives” — and bemoans a fixation on wealth and appearances: “It's easy to be pretty with money, right?/Money rots people and makes them beautiful at the same time — it’s fascinating.” Factory noises, distant shouts and trap percussion are laced through a track that revolves around four somber but ascending chords, mourning what it’s selling. J.P. Two decades ago, the Norwegian production and songwriting duo Stargate — Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel Eriksen — had its breakthrough with saccharine teen Europop, and in the mid-2000s, evolved into creators of some of this country’s most supple R&B. The pair has recently signed to RCA Records as artists, whatever that might mean. Judging by “1Night,” it suggests a DJ Khaled-like ability to cobble together compelling songs from disparate parts. “1Night” is lightly sinister and maybe a bit gloomy, a dead-eyed celebration of fleeting lust — and certainly less joyful than Lil Yachty’s breakthrough hit of similar name — that comes up for air when 21 Savage arches his eyebrow: “Savage getting married?/Pshhhh/Yeah, right.” J.C. How gently can you weave polyrhythms together? The vocalist Sara Serpa joins Sun Speak — the duo of Matt Gold, a guitarist, and Nate Friedman, a drummer — on a new self-titled album, and this track finds her doing what she’s best at: singing without words in a focused, fluid voice, like steam escaping upward through a fine bore. Mr. Gold and Mr. Friedman climb a pile of post-rock rubble underneath, making a 34-beat cycle that sighs and heaves and finally disappears. G.R. Seething and then exploding is how the rock songwriter Meg Myers works, and in “Numb” her target is the kind of mentor — musical or otherwise — who undermines her in the guise of helpfulness. Feeling pressure, she goes numb. The dynamics come directly from the Pixies, with a slow, loping bass line behind the verses on the way to the feedback-frothed power chords of the chorus; she won’t be acquiescent much longer. J.P. Liz Harris, who records as Grouper, turns pretty sounds and slow, sparse arrangements into haunted reveries. “Parking Lot” is from her 10th album, “Grid of Points,” being released today. It’s a brief collection of seven songs that use only a lone piano and her whispery vocals — sometimes solo, more often wafting in as overdubbed harmonies — all suspended amid reverberations and hiss. She plays tolling chords and hesitantly phrased melodies on the piano, while the words hover at the edge of intelligibility. It’s music at home in perpetual dusk. J.P. SoundCloud rap’s Sunset Strip moment has arrived in the form of Paris, a melancholy genre hybridizer who’s a clear inheritor of Lil Peep, but also of the morbid arena rap-rock of the early 2000s. Last week he released a strong new album, “One Night in Paris,” that features “Gone,” a yowling collaboration with Trippie Redd, and “Shining,” a catchy tragedy anchored by a clever and taut lament: “Stab me in the back/All you do is front.” J.C. Todd Marcus, a bass clarinetist and community activist in Baltimore who runs the nonprofit Intersection of Change, is releasing his latest album just days after the third anniversary of the death of Freddie Gray in police custody. The LP, “On These Streets,” weaves in testimonials from Baltimore residents with Mr. Marcus’s bristling originals, like “Ground Zero (at Penn. & North).” Named for the intersection now symbolic of Mr. Gray’s death, the track begins in a dark swarm, then picks up momentum as Kris Funn’s stout bass playing crisscrosses with George Colligan’s quickened piano patterns. Mr. Marcus rushes forth, wrangling a proclamation of vision and conviction from the gusty bass clarinet. G.R. Jon Pareles has been The Times's chief pop music critic since 1988.

business,"By Norm Alster While many companies have shrewdly taken advantage of rock-bottom interest rates over the last decade, bulging debt in industries like retail, energy and telecommunications is a burden that investors may need to worry about. Many retailers, for example, have been struggling with competition from online giants like Amazon and Walmart. The debt of major companies like Neiman Marcus, PetSmart and Sears is already rated as speculative (also known as high-yeld or junk). And Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at Standard & Poor’s, said many debt-laden retailers have already suffered credit downgrades this year. These include Sears, Payless and Guitar Center Holdings. Once a company’s debt is downgraded to speculative from investment grade, it may find the footing more slippery. Companies that fall into speculative grade ratings (B- or lower in the S.&P. ratings system) tend to accelerate toward even lower ratings, Ms. Vazza said. The risk to investors — and the interest the companies must pay for new borrowing — rises, adding to cash flow stress. When the stress is great enough, companies can fail. Bond managers emphasize that the picture for retailers is not monochromatic. Some have adapted to online competition with effective online shopping options. And some areas of retail seem quite healthy, said Michael G. Wildstein, portfolio manager of the Delaware Corporate Bond fund. Mr. Wildstein said the retail industry was “bifurcated.” “The department store model is being disrupted by Amazon,” he said, and many department stores are suffering. On the other hand, he said, the home improvement giants are seemingly unaffected: “Home Depot and Lowe’s continue to do well.” Brian Ruffner, manager of the Federated Bond fund, said auto parts stores should also flourish in a positive economic environment Debt loads aren’t merely a concern for fixed-income investors. Equity investors need to be aware of debt loads at troubled companies because, in a severe case, bankruptcy would wipe out the value of any stock holdings. For equity investors who are bullish about online retail outlets and skeptical about more traditional stores, the ProShares Long Online/Short Stores exchange-traded fund may be a useful vehicle: It invests in online purveyors while betting against challenged brick and mortar retailers. Energy is another industry where debt is worrisome. Oil and gas companies carry large loads of lower-rated debt that is due to mature in the next five years, according to S.&P. New fracking technology has helped to expand domestic oil and gas output and loosened the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ grip on prices. But as the new supply depresses prices, it also pinches cash flow. Indeed, 14 of 16 midsize and larger drillers tracked by Gordon Douthat, a director of equity research at Wells Fargo Securities, had higher capital spending costs than cash flow last year: Anadarko Petroleum, Noble Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources are among them. Carl Kaufman, who manages the Osterweis Strategic Income fund, said of domestic drillers: “Those companies don’t throw off any cash.” One central problem is the modest level of oil prices which, despite a recent rebound, remain well below highs of over $100 a barrel. Mr. Wildstein said he expects them to remain “around $60” “We don’t believe they’ll go back to the $70s or $80s,” he said. For investors who are bearish on the price of oil, there is the ProShares UltraShort Bloomberg Crude Oil E.T.F. For equity investors who expect domestic drillers to rebound eventually, there are E.T.F.s like iShares U.S. Oil and Gas Exploration & Production.  Telecom debt also is worth watching. Citing increased price competition, Moody’s has a negative outlook on the entire sector. Bill Wolfe, Moody’s senior vice president, said the industry was rife with “large companies with a lot of debt,” including Frontier Communications, CenturyLink and Sprint. Verizon Communications also carries a large debt load, but it may be something of a special case. “They’re an extremely large issuer,” Mr. Wildstein said. One important positive for Verizon, Mr. Wolfe said, is that it has “the premier wireless network.” But the cost of upgrading that network may also be a Verizon vulnerability. The company is moving aggressively to put in place 5G technology, which uses higher frequencies to speed wireless transmission. But 5G is expensive to install, and it faces widespread opposition in many municipalities and from some scientists, who say it entails health risks. Mr. Wildstein’s fund holds Verizon debt, and he says the company may be overly dependent on its wireless network. It needs to diversify by acquiring a cable provider or media company, he said. Robert Persons, a manager of the MFS Corporate Bond fund, is also concerned about Verizon’s 5G expenditures. “We are monitoring that closely,” he said. With uncertainty and controversy overhanging the 5G rollout, he wonders: “Will it be worth the capital investment?” Verizon lists its total debt as $117.1 billion. “We want to strengthen the balance sheet,” Matthew D. Ellis, the company’s chief financial officer, said on a Jan. 23 earnings call. “You should expect us to deleverage from where we are today,” he added. Outside these industries, debt is high for much of corporate America but probably manageable, several analysts said. “The leverage is elevated — companies are borrowing more,” said Mr. Wolfe of Moody’s. But since they are borrowing at historically low rates, their repayment abilities have not been measurably affected, he noted. Among investment-grade companies, the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, to interest expense has inched up to 9.9 in the 12 months through Sept. 30, 2017, from 9.7 in 2010. Companies with speculative-grade — also known as high-yield — debt have also seen their Ebitda-to-interest expense ratios improve a bit, Moody’s reports. The broad outlook for corporate bonds isn’t entirely rosy. Interest rates have been rising, and S.&P. estimates that more than $4 trillion in corporate debt will have to be refinanced — presumably at even higher interest rates — by the end of 2022. But S.& P. doesn’t expect this refinancing to cause undue problems.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
business,"Common Sense By James B. Stewart At a time when many law firm partnerships are revolving doors, the move by several partners from one large firm to another would hardly merit headlines. Unless the firms in question are the old-line Cravath, Swaine & Moore and the disruptive Kirkland & Ellis, and the money involved is so big that star partners are being valued like Hollywood celebrities and professional athletes. Kirkland said last week that a senior Cravath partner, Sandra Goldstein, a former leader of the firm’s litigation department, would be joining Kirkland with a Cravath associate, Stefan Atkinson. Ms. Goldstein’s move followed those of three other Cravath partners who defected to Kirkland since 2012. What has the legal profession’s upper ranks abuzz is that for decades partners almost never left Cravath voluntarily — not for other law firms, at least, let alone for a firm like Kirkland, which is in some ways Cravath’s polar opposite. “It was unheard-of for a Cravath partner to go to another law firm,” said David Lat, the founding editor of the legal website Above the Law. “Now it’s happening with some regularity.” Brad S. Karp, the chairman of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, said ‘‘the nature of big law’’ had changed. “There has been a gradual but steady erosion of both client and partner loyalty,’’ said Mr. Karp, who hired Scott Barshay, the former leader of Cravath’s corporate department, in 2016. “A generation ago, clients were reflexively loyal to their law firms. The relationship today is more transactional and clients tend to be more loyal to particular partners. This new paradigm creates more opportunity, but also creates more flux.” On the rare occasions that Cravath partners did leave, they certainly didn’t do it for money, given that they have traditionally been among the highest-paid in the profession. (I’m a former Cravath associate who took a pay cut to pursue journalism.) Yet not even Cravath partners make the kind of money that enticed Ms. Goldstein to join Kirkland: $11 million a year for five years, plus a signing bonus, according to two people who discussed the terms with her. The figure is an estimate and not technically a guarantee, since Kirkland pays partners who have equity in the firm based on their shares, the value of which can fluctuate based on the firm’s performance. Ms. Goldstein declined to comment. Kirkland has been spending lavishly. It paid its former partner Robert Khuzami $11.1 million for his work at the firm from late 2016 to early 2018, according to the financial disclosures Mr. Khuzami filed when he became deputy United States attorney in Manhattan. A Kirkland spokeswoman declined to comment for this column. Mr. Barshay will earn $10 million in 2018 to lead Paul Weiss’s global mergers and acquisitions practice, according to people familiar with the arrangement. That departures from Cravath would create such a stir in the legal profession is, in many ways, a tribute to its brand and reputation. Founded in 1819, Cravath will celebrate its 200th anniversary next year, only the second major American firm to reach such a milestone. (Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft was founded in 1792.) Paul D. Cravath, a patriarchal figure at the firm in the early 20th century, essentially invented the modern large law firm, where teams of lawyers apply themselves to client needs across a broad range of issues. At Cravath, young lawyers are carefully selected and then rigorously trained and promoted in what has become known as the Cravath system. At the partnership level, the firm is strictly egalitarian. In one of Cravath’s most distinctive features, partner compensation is determined solely by seniority, a system known as lockstep. That compensation is — and, for many years, has been — extremely generous: The American Lawyer’s annual survey of partnership income, which was released this week, showed Cravath partners earning, on average, $4 million last year. “Our compensation model is just one element of our approach to producing the quality that we want our brand to represent,” said Faiza J. Saeed, the firm’s presiding partner, when we spoke this week. “It incentivizes partners to invest in the training and development of our people and aligns partner and client interests by encouraging partners to collaborate and deliver the full expertise of the firm.’’ Needless to say, it also relieves the pressure on partners to meet annual billing targets. Ms. Saeed conceded that the lockstep-compensation system removes a powerful lever of management control. It puts a high premium on partner selection and development, and requires attention to ensure that partners uphold all aspects of the social compact, not just in terms of their contribution but also in how they reflect the values of the partnership. A desire to change the Cravath system and the resulting internal friction was a factor in some of the recent departures. “Kirkland is the antithesis of Cravath when it comes to compensation,” said Bruce MacEwen, president of Adam Smith, Esq., a consultant to law firms, who writes widely about their economics. “It’s very individualistic and competitive, with a very big spread between the highest- and lowest-paid partners. But Kirkland has a reputation for excellence that rivals Cravath’s.” There is no doubt that Kirkland, which has expanded rapidly from its Chicago headquarters, has been on a roll. The American Lawyer’s annual survey of the largest law firms measured by revenue shows that it took in $3.165 billion last year, displacing Latham & Watkins from the top spot — an achievement Kirkland partners will celebrate next week at their annual retreat in Southern California Kirkland’s 19.4 percent growth rate in revenue last year compared with the previous year was the largest of any firm on The American Lawyer’s list. Although its traditional strength has been in private equity transactions — a field it dominates — it was also ranked first last year by the website Mergermarket in mergers and acquisitions, with 447 deals. Cravath has never aimed to be the biggest firm, in terms of revenue or number of lawyers. But it does put a premium on profitability. This year, Kirkland edged out Cravath on that count, too, with average profits per equity partner of $4.7 million, according to The American Lawyer. (The figures don’t account for Cravath’s gold-plated pension plan, which is among the most generous in the profession.) Kirkland has shaken up the profession and expanded its practice by poaching top partners not just from Cravath, but from other prominent, old-line firms, including Latham and Skadden Arps Meagher Slate & Flom. It has raided the venerable Simpson Thacher & Bartlett in New York for so many partners that one Kirkland partner, in a widely circulated email, referred to Simpson as “Kirkland’s AAA farm club.” In contrast to the lockstep system, which is still used by a dwindling number of law firms, albeit some of the most prestigious, Kirkland’s approach is a star system known somewhat pejoratively as “eat what you kill.” Kirkland has been far more successful at this than Dewey & LeBoeuf, which imploded in 2012 after poaching partners from other firms and offering outsize guarantees it could not meet. Unlike Dewey, Kirkland’s equity partners know what every one of their peers makes. Still, many question the long-term viability of Kirkland’s unabashed star system and lavish pay packages. “Is ‘eat-what-you-kill’ inherently unstable?” Mr. MacEwen said. “That’s a good question. The Kirkland model risks emphasizing the star at the expense of the team. The existential risk for a Kirkland is that they go too far and forget all the B players they still really need.” For now, Mr. Lat said, “Kirkland is surging, with their New York and London offices every bit as impressive as Chicago.” He added: “They’re a global powerhouse. What’s impressive is they’ve grown the top line while increasing their profits and prestige. There’s usually a trade off.” Cravath, too, seems to be thriving. The firm said that 2015 through 2017 had been its three best years ever in terms of revenue thanks to booming mergers and acquisitions and litigation practices. Ms. Saeed said the firm had no intention of modifying its compensation system. “Our partners value both the monetary and non-monetary benefits of being here,’’ she said, “which includes the opportunity to work with incredibly talented people on challenging and high profile matters.” Cravath currently represents Disney in its bid to acquire major assets from 21st Century Fox, and it represents Time Warner in the high- stakes antitrust case over its planned merger with AT&T.

business,"By Thomas B. Edsall Over the next six months, Democratic voters will be asked again and again whether their party’s candidates should hew to the center or move to the left. How voters answer that question will help shape the strategic plans of the dozen or more Democrats jockeying to beat President Trump in 2020. The intraparty tension has been simmering for months. Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, goaded party centrists last May when he declared abortion a Democratic litmus test: “Every Democrat, like every American, should support a woman’s right to make her own choices about her body and her health,” Perez said in a statement. “That is not negotiable and should not change city by city or state by state.” Perez later backed off. But in July, Ben Ray Luján, a congressman from New Mexico who is the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, declared that not only would the D.C.C.C. support anti-abortion Democrats, he was already working closely with the Blue Dog caucus — the party’s 18-member conservative House faction, which includes several members who oppose abortion rights — to recruit candidates for 2018. “There is not a litmus test for Democratic candidates,” Luján told The Hill. “You need to make sure you have candidates that fit the district, that can win in these districts across America.” “The Democratic Party cannot give an inch in their opposition to this Administration,” Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, countered. That is “especially true when it comes to abortion rights. The Democratic Party cannot and will not win if it turns its back on women and our fundamental rights.” “The days of the Blue Dogs are over,” Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, declared in an interview with Bloomberg News. The center-versus-left theme dominated the nasty primary fight for the Democratic nomination in the Illinois Third District on Tuesday. The incumbent, Dan Lipinski, a conservative abortion opponent, edged out his liberal challenger, Marie Newman, 51.2-48.8 — a contest in which several of Lipinski’s own colleagues rooted for his defeat. Social and cultural issues played a huge role in the campaign. “This was a district where some of us as individuals decided to get involved,” Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Politico. “I would like my husband and I to be considered equal by colleagues in our caucus.” No matter who won, the district was expected to stay in Democratic hands in the general election. The more significant election in the Democrats’ strategic debate was the widely publicized special election victory last week of Conor Lamb, a moderate Democrat, in a mostly white, working-to-middle class western Pennsylvania congressional district. Lamb’s success in flipping a hard-core Republican electorate placed the choice facing Democrats running for president and those running for House and Senate in swing districts and states front and center: Does the path to victory lie in mobilizing the liberal base — by taking explicitly left-wing stands on immigration, as well as gun rights, universal health care, the minimum wage, racial justice and so on? Or is the widespread hatred of Donald Trump — at least among Democrats — sufficient to turn out progressive and minority voters, which would make undecideds the constituency that must be more actively wooed? Lamb pointedly strayed from Democratic orthodoxy on the Second Amendment, minimum wage and Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs. His willingness to break with his party on those issues was crucial to his victory. As a decorated veteran, Lamb muted Democratic liabilities on military issues. By winning a district that Trump had carried by 20 percentage points, Lamb set off a national debate. “These results should terrify Republicans,” Luján, the D.C.C.C. chair, declared. “There are more than 100 districts more favorable for Democrats than this one, and we look forward to competing hard in every single one.” “Democrats Can Run the Conor Lamb Strategy Over and Over” read the headline of an article by Jonathan Chait in New York magazine: There are a lot of Conor Lambs out there. Very early in the election cycle, Democrats recruited candidates with nontraditional backgrounds, especially in the military, who would appeal to voters in red districts. No way, Bob Moser argued in a Rolling Stone essay, “Why Democrats Should Worry About Conor Lamb’s Victory.” “The real message of Lamb’s campaign basically boiled down to this: ‘Look at what a fine young normal white fellow I am!’ ” Moser wrote. The “clamor for centrism,” according to Moser, risks deflating the Resistance, turning off nonwhite voters, and dampening the turnout that Democrats should be able to expect in November, given the level of Trump animus across the country. This intraparty struggle will not be resolved on the merits. It will be hammered out by strategists and candidates over the next two and a half years and will ultimately be decided by Democratic primary voters. The evidence suggests that the balance of power among these voters is shifting to the left. Since 1976, there has been a steady reduction in the number of conservative voters participating in Democratic primaries, according to Seth J. Hill and Chris Tausanovitch, political scientists at U.C.L.A. and U.C.S.D. in their paper “Southern realignment, party sorting, and the polarization of American primary electorates, 1958 — 2012.” In 1976, conservative Democrats were a significant force within the party, making up 27 percent of its supporters. By 1992, their share fell to 24 percent, still a factor to be reckoned with, providing a crucial source of support to Bill Clinton. By 2012 — the last year for which the authors have data — conservative Democrats had been marginalized in primaries, reduced to 7 percent. Over the latter third of the 20th century, Hill and Tausanovitch write, conservatives sorted into the Republican primary, liberals sorted into the Democratic primary, and centrists began turning out at somewhat lower rates in primary elections. These trends are illustrated in the accompanying graphics for 1976, 1992 and 2012. Each chart breaks the electorate into deciles: the first decile, on the left, is the most liberal; the tenth, on the right, the most conservative. I asked Tausanovitch what the implications were for moderate Democrats looking at 2018 and 2020: Clearly the Democratic primary electorate is more extreme in recent elections than in 1992. This appears to be the result of party sorting: liberals are more likely to be Democrats, and conservatives are more likely to be Republicans than in the past. Asked whether a centrist Democrat like Bill Clinton — who came out for the death penalty, welfare reform, “rights and responsibilities” and who publicly rebuffed the rapper and activist Sister Souljah — could win the nomination today, Tausanovitch replied: If primary voters choose the candidate that most closely reflects their views, then there isn’t much hope for a more moderate Democrat. There are a substantial number of Democrats, especially among party officials, activists and consultants, who believe that candidates, especially at the presidential level, need to stake out centrist positions and avoid the perception of being in lock step with liberal interest groups. In a March 17 article in The Hill, Dan Glickman, a former congressman from Kansas, asked “what was the message” Conor Lamb’s victory sent to Democrats? His answer: It means that being a calm, thoughtful and polite moderate is a winning strategy once more. Glickman and his centrist allies are, however, likely to be drowned out by the vociferous opposition to this idea. Not only has the ideological composition of the Democratic electorate shifted leftward, but with Trump in the White House, the liberal wing of the Democratic Party has become energized in a way that has driven a national grass-roots mobilization. Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt, provided insight into the Democratic strategic dilemma in a recent paper, “Partisanship in the Trump Era.” Bartels determined that Democrats are close to united in their support of an activist government that reduces the gap between rich and poor, regulates the environment and insures access to health care. Still, according to Bartels, cultural issues sow discord among Democrats. While more than a quarter of Democratic voters, 26.3 percent, are “closer to the Republicans than to their fellow Democrats” on cultural attitudes, nearly three quarters of Democrats, 73.9 percent, are more liberal on cultural issues. In an email, Bartels described these culturally liberal Democrats as: relatively more enthusiastic about atheists, gays and lesbians, and Muslims; more negative about Fox News, Walmart, and Christians; more willing to rely on “experts”; less likely to say that “anyone who is willing to work hard can still achieve the American dream”; more likely to deny that “the interests of ethnic and racial minority groups often conflict with those of the white majority”; less “authoritarian” (as measured by questions about child-rearing), further to the left in their ideological self-placements, and more pro-choice on abortion. According to Bartels, Democrats who are most firmly culturally liberal are overwhelmingly white. I exchanged emails with a Democratic consultant who has played a prominent role in presidential, Senate and House elections. He asked to remain anonymous in order to be more candid. The first question I posed was: Could Lamb — who did not face a primary — have won the seat if the contest had been held in 2016, during a general election? The answer was no: We know that PA-18 was not winnable in a year with Hillary at the top of the ticket. Democrats did not win any seat with the demographic profile of this one anywhere in the country in 2016 — save for handful of longtime incumbents. How about 2020? Could a centrist like Bill Clinton get the nomination? I’d say the answer is “no.” I think the politics of the Democratic Party have changed significantly since that time and while it may not be the MOST liberal candidate who wins the nomination, all viable candidates will have to pass a certain threshold of liberal-ness. One of the best case studies of center-left intraparty schism can be seen in the upcoming May 22 runoff election for the Democratic nomination in the 7th Congressional District in Texas — upscale suburban Houston. The two candidates are Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a local lawyer who led the primary with 29.3 percent and is generally viewed as the moderate, establishment candidate (referred to as Republican-lite by her opponents), and Laura Moser, a liberal political activist, author and former journalist, who came in second with 24.3 percent, and was described by the Houston Chronicle as the candidate of “those who want a full-fledged push to the left to provide the starkest possible contrast with Trump.” The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, convinced that Moser would be a weak general election candidate, turned the primary contest into an internecine clash when it released a document on Feb. 22 designed to damage Moser’s bid: She is a Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress. In fact, she wrote in Washingtonian magazine, “I’d rather have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia” than live in Texas. As of January 2018, she claimed Washington, D.C. to be her primary residence in order to get a tax break. The attack by the D.C.C.C., viewed by many in the liberal wing of the party as aggressively centrist, generated a backlash, mobilizing the left in support of Moser. She now has endorsements from Howard Dean’s group, Democracy for America, Bernie Sanders’ Our Revolution and the insurgent Justice Democrats. “The D.C.C.C.’s ridiculous attacks on Laura Moser are why Democrats nationally have lost over 1,100 seats. Laura is a rising progressive advocate that the workaday people of Texas desperately need,” Jim Hightower, a board member of Our Revolution, said. “She is an active organizer who takes on the Powers That Be on behalf of the Powers That Ought To Be — workers, consumers, small businesses, and just plain folks.” The district has been in Republican hands for 52 years, since George H.W. Bush first won the seat in 1966. In the 2016 election, however, Hillary Clinton beat Trump there, 49-47, abruptly putting the 10-term Republican incumbent, John Culberson, high on the Democrats’ target list. Whoever wins the runoff, the general election will provide a test of Democratic competitive strength in what could be called Hillary districts — Republican-held seats where she did well. These districts are relatively affluent — in the case of the 7th District, the median household income is $71,183, substantially above the national median of $57,617 and the Texas median, $54,727; and well-educated — 50.7 percent with a college degree or higher, compared to 30.3 percent nationwide and 28.1 percent in all Texas. To bring this full circle, the upscale 7th District in Texas and the downscale 18th District in Pennsylvania effectively represent the dilemma of a party increasingly dominated by cultural liberals. In Texas, that may not prove a liability. Both Moser and Fletcher are on the left on predominantly cultural issues like immigration, gun rights and gay rights. Those positions are clearly becoming more acceptable among affluent, college-educated voters, a constituency in which Democrats have been making steady gains. It is in less well-to-do places like Conor Lamb’s Pennsylvania 18 — where 32.9 percent have a college degree or higher and the median household income of $58,600. Among Lamb’s constituents, cultural liberalism is, consequently, a liability — even fatal, electorally speaking. Democrats can be expected to continue to make gains in upscale districts, especially those that voted for Clinton. But in this election cycle — largely because of the Trump presidency — Democrats have a shot, for the first time in over a decade, at taking back a substantial number of the white working class districts that turned Republican in recent elections. As party leaders have been quick to point out, 118 Republican incumbents represent districts in which Trump’s margin of victory was smaller than it was for Conor Lamb. To nominate candidates who, like Lamb, are equipped to win working and middle class swing districts in the general election will require Democratic primary voters to cast strategic rather than ideological ballots — focusing on who can prevail in November, in 2018 but also in 2020. And, perhaps more to the point, Democratic donors will have to decide whether they can back candidates who agree with them 80 percent but not 99 percent of the time. At a moment when Trump has exacerbated polarization, persuading leaders and voters on the left flank of the Democratic Party to think tactically about the 2020 presidential primaries is crucial but problematic. Insofar as Democrats place a higher priority on purity than viability, they may be risking an indeterminate extension of the Trump era. I invite you to follow me on Twitter, @Edsall.

business,"By Reuters (Reuters) - Newell Brands Inc said on Friday it would sell its plastics packaging unit Waddington Group for $2.3 billion (1.7 billion pounds), and added more brands to a divestiture plan aimed at streamlining its operations and cutting costs. The sale of Waddington, which makes disposable cutlery and drinkware, is the first major divestiture after activist investors Starboard Value LP and Carl Icahn placed their nominees on the company's board last month. Newell's shares were up 6 percent at $28.29 in early trading. The stock took a beating after the company, which sells everything from Sharpie pens to Crock-Pot cookware, first laid out plans in January to explore options for several of its businesses. As part of its agreement with Icahn, Newell said in March its divestitures would bring in about $10 billion, ratcheting it up from its previous estimate of $6 billion. Newell said on Friday it would add Jostens and Pure Fishing to the list of brands it plans to sell, with the expanded divestiture plan ultimately reducing its net sales and workforce by more than a third. The moves come as the company's retailer customers such as Walmart Inc and Target Corp pare back inventories to cut costs as fewer shoppers visit brick-and-mortar stores. ""All of these assets should command competitive multiples ... the sale of Waddington validates that belief,"" Chief Executive Officer Michael Polk said during a conference call. Newell said its divestiture process was ""well underway"" and expects to complete all transactions by the end of 2019 and become a company with net sales of about $9.5 billion in 2020. ""Investors never wanted Newell to own Waddington and likely underestimated the multiple a sale could bring,"" Renaissance Macro Securities analyst April Scee said. The company also reported first-quarter sales that fell nearly 8 percent and missed analysts' estimates, mainly due to divestitures in 2017 and the liquidation of Toys 'R' Us. But normalised earnings of 34 cents per share beat the average estimate of 26 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""With continued organic weakness and conflict with Starboard ongoing, there's enough noise in the stock ... However, intended divestitures improve focus or help odds of successful restructuring,"" Scee said. The company also reaffirmed 2018 net sales and earnings forecast.

business,"By Cade Metz MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — If you want to understand the priorities of a technology company, first look at the seating chart. At Google’s Silicon Valley headquarters, the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, now shares a floor with Google Brain, a research lab dedicated to artificial intelligence. When Facebook created its own artificial intelligence lab at its offices about seven miles away, it temporarily gave A.I. researchers desks next to the fish bowl of a conference room where its chief executive and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, holds his meetings. “I can high-five Mark and Sheryl from my desk, and the A.I. team was right next to us,” said Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, referring to Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer. Even Overstock.com, the online retailer based in the Salt Lake City area, now runs a mini-research operation called OLabs. It sits directly outside the office of the company’s chief executive, Patrick Byrne. A growing number of tech companies are pushing research labs and other far-reaching engineering efforts closer to the boss. The point is unmistakable: What they are doing matters to the chief executive. It may even be the future of the company. “The world is moving faster and faster. It is being driven by technology and innovation,” said John Kotter, an emeritus professor at Harvard Business School who has written several books on business leadership. “And a lot of these businesses are concluding that the speed of technological innovation should be the heart of everything.” A year ago, the Google Brain team of mathematicians, coders and hardware engineers sat in a small office building on the other side of the company’s campus. But over the past few months, it switched buildings and now works right beside the loungelike area where Mr. Pichai and other top executives work. Jeffrey Dean, the celebrated Google engineer who oversees the Brain lab, is a short walk from Mr. Pichai. So are Ian Goodfellow, the researcher behind a new A.I. technique that generates lifelike images on its own, and Norm Jouppi, who explores ways of accelerating A.I. research through a new breed of computer chip. “Any C.E.O. thinks a lot about where people are sitting — who they can walk around and have casual conversations with,” said Diane Greene, who oversees Google’s cloud computing team and sits on the board of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. “It is a very significant statement that he has moved that group right next him.” Google is placing big bets on the A.I. being explored by researchers like Mr. Goodfellow. Many questions still hang over the progress of this research. But Mr. Pichai and the rest of the Google leadership hope it will accelerate the evolution of everything from smartphones and home appliances to internet services and robotics. To Mr. Byrne, shaking up the seating chart at Overstock was a bit like a common management tactic in the military, when an officer will work closely with a small “command initiatives group” that is considerably more nimble than the rest of the organization. “We were getting bureaucratic,” Mr. Byrne said. “And this was a way of creating added competition outside the bureaucracy.” These big companies are trying to duplicate the vibe of a Silicon Valley start-up, where the boss is next to everyone. As start-ups grow, they often put key technology teams next to the chief executive. Ms. Greene, who was the chief executive of the software company VMware, said she had always made a point of sitting beside the top engineers because they saw the company’s future. There are limits to these arrangements. When Facebook built a team to explore the future of virtual reality on its vast social network, it made a similar desk move. The group is no longer seated next to Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook said this was because the group had grown too large. But across Silicon Valley, virtual reality is no longer the buzziest of topics. That honor belongs to artificial intelligence. Where you sit has mattered for years at Facebook. The company’s ad group traditionally sat far away from Mr. Zuckerberg. But after Facebook went public and started a big push for revenue, important members of the ad team moved next to the boss, said Antonio García Martínez, who wrote a book about his experiences inside Facebook. At Overstock, Mr. Byrne walks past his small research team every time he leaves his office. Like Ms. Greene, he sees this as an opportunity for spontaneous interaction. The team members can discuss their work with him, and Mr. Byrne, a doctor of philosophy with a long history of unorthodox business choices, will share his far-reaching ideas with them. And he gets to hear, without the pressure of a formal presentation, what the engineers are excited about. “It was undeniable that proximity sparked conversation,” said Judd Bagley, a kind of roving technologist and strategist who once worked in this group. “Patrick prides himself on being able to walk up to anyone at the company, say ‘hello,’ and occasionally even eat french fries off the plate on their desk.” Through OLabs, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept payment in the Bitcoin digital currency, and the lab eventually produced a company spinoff that seeks to apply the Bitcoin ethos to financial trading. Now, in an echo of the A.I. labs at Google and Facebook, the operation is focused on machine learning, which involves systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing large amounts of data. If a chief executive is close to these researchers, he or she is learning from them. But the boss is also showing them how important they are to the company. That is enormously valuable for engineers and mathematicians who are not necessarily generating immediate revenue, said Kevin Quennesson, a start-up executive who ran an A.I. team at Twitter. He also warned that companies risked putting too much pressure on researchers to produce results from work that was, by definition, a trip into the unknown. Amid so much spontaneous conversation with the chief executive, Mr. Bagley said, it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between “the formal direction and informal brainstorming.” Status at Facebook was defined by how close your desk was to Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Martínez said. And if you were close to the boss, other groups resented you. Priorities also tend to ebb and flow. At Overstock, a new Bitcoin project will squeeze in beside OLabs. And at Facebook, the A.I. lab is no longer side by side with Mr. Zuckerberg because it also grew too large. Still, this work is particularly important to the company as it works to ensure “the safety and integrity of our community” — which has become Facebook code for guarding against false, misleading or dangerous activity on its social network, Mr. Schroepfer said. And the A.I. team is still only a short walk from Mr. Zuckerberg.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
business,"By Reuters SAN FRANCISCO — Ducking analysts' questions has a price: $2 billion. Tesla Inc investors gave a rare rebuke to iconoclastic Chief Executive Elon Musk on Wednesday after he cut off analysts asking about profit potential, sending shares down 5 percent despite promises that production of the troubled Model 3 electric car was on track. Tesla's future depends on the Model 3 and the company said that it had largely overcome production bottlenecks, with Musk vowing a dramatic turnaround that would reverse losses and generate positive cash flow in just a few months.  Musk plans to shut down its Fremont, California factory for 10 days in the second quarter but said Tesla will meet the production target of 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June, as planned, and will turn a profit in the second half of the year.  To achieve profitability, Musk will have to reverse what today amounts to a $22,584 pre-tax loss per vehicle built by the Silicon Valley company. Tesla posted its biggest-ever quarterly loss when it announced first-quarter results on Wednesday. Tesla stock was little changed after the earnings announcement but fell during a conference call, when Musk began cutting analysts' questions short, costing Tesla over $2 billion in market capitalization.  ""These questions are so dry. They're killing me,"" Musk said after an analyst asked what percentage of Tesla 3 reservation holders have started to configure options for their cars, an indicator of how much profit Tesla will be able to wring from the vehicles. Another analyst asked about a capital requirement before being cut off.  He then took several questions in a row about plans for a self-driving car network and other long-term projects from the host of a YouTube channel focused on investing, praising the questions as not boring.  5,000 MODEL 3s PER WEEK Musk's ability to run Tesla is crucial as the company strives to efficiently and profitably build its first vehicle intended to be produced at high volume, the Model 3. Musk acknowledged error recently in over-automating the Model 3 assembly-line, which has resulted in production delays, but it is still unclear how long and costly it will be to unwind this mistake. Delayed Model 3 production also comes as a slew of competitors bring new electric vehicle models to market.  The company stood by a previously announced target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of June. Tesla's capital expenditures declined in the quarter and the company cut its spending forecasts for 2018, saying it would spend less than $3 billion. Tesla spent $3.4 billion in 2017. (https://bit.ly/2jn15SB)  Investing.com analyst Clement Thibault said the reduction was noteworthy, ""but in the long run given challenges that lay ahead of Tesla, I don't think it is going to make or break the company."" Tesla ""is definitely not in a minimizing cost stage,"" Thibault said.  Free cash flow, a key metric of financial health, widened to negative $1 billion in the first quarter from negative $277 million in the fourth quarter, excluding costs of systems for its solar business. Analysts had not expected so much spending, predicting hundreds of millions of dollars less in so-called cash burn, according to Thomson Reuters data. Tesla did not break out a cash flow calculation that it had included in previous quarters. The niche carmaker, which two years ago vowed to build 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018, has attracted legions of fans for its advanced technology and design. But the company rushed its Model 3 to market, making mistakes in manufacturing whose effects are now being felt, and investor skepticism has risen. Questions over Tesla's finances are top of mind, and many analysts anticipate a capital raise in 2018 despite Musk's statements that it will not be necessary due to profitability and positive cash flow in the third or fourth quarters.  Tesla said gross margins on the Model 3, which today are slightly negative, would be close to flat in the second quarter and grow to ""highly positive"" in the second half of the year. Tesla said it produced 2,270 Model 3s per week in the last week of April. It said net reservations for the Model 3, including configured orders not yet delivered, exceeded 450,000 at the end of the first quarter. Automotive revenue rose only 1 percent from the prior quarter to $2.74 billion. RECORD LOSS Tesla reported a record loss of $709.6 million, or $4.19 per share, for the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $330.3 million, or $2.04 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Tesla had a loss of $3.35 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of $3.58 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said it ended the quarter with $3.2 billion in cash after spending $655.7 million in quarterly capital expenses. The lack of Model 3 revenue has exacerbated Tesla's cash burn as the company continues to spend on its assembly line and prepares for new investments on multiple projects in the pipeline, such as the Model Y crossover and its Gigafactory. The Model Y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for Tesla, which also launched a Tesla Semi and a new Roadster in recent months.

business,"By Reuters (Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Wednesday as surging oil prices boosted energy stocks following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision the previous day to quit a nuclear agreement with Iran. Gains were broad and volume was high, with all but the utilities and telecom sectors advancing as investors who had moved to the sidelines in recent days ahead of Trump's decision returned to the market. ""It's classic 'buy on the terrible news',"" said Ian Winer, director of trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles, referring to the wider market's rally. ""People had gotten way too nervous about this."" Trump's decision for the United States pull out of the international agreement aimed at preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon was good news for investors betting on a rise in oil prices. Crude hit its highest level in 3-1/2 years as investors bet the U.S. withdrawal would increase risks of conflict in the Middle East and curtail global oil supplies. The S&P energy index jumped 2.03 percent, bringing its gain this quarter to 12.6 percent, more than any other sector. ""The rise in oil is helping energy sector, which is expected to be a pretty big growth sector. A lot of analysts are expecting strong earnings as oil rebounds, and that hasn't really played out so much early this year,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.75 percent to end at 24,542.54 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.97 percent to 2,697.79. The Nasdaq Composite added 1 percent to finish the session at 7,339.91. The Cboe Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility for the S&P 500, closed down 1.29 points at 13.42, its lowest close since Jan. 26. Worries lingered that rising oil prices would perk up inflation. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield <US10YT=RR> rose to a two-week high and above the key 3 percent level on expectations of higher interest rates. [US/] With March-quarter reports mostly wrapped up, S&P 500 earnings per share appear to have surged by 25.9 percent, helped by deep corporate tax cuts introduced this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In stock trading, Google-owner Alphabet Inc rose 2.87 percent, providing more lift than any other stock to the S&P 500. It was followed by Facebook Inc, which rose 2.09 percent. Walmart Inc fell 3.13 percent after the retailer took a majority stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart for about $16 billion. Walt Disney dipped 1.79 percent despite reporting a quarterly profit above Wall Street estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.71-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.65-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 40 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 168 new highs and 52 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 7.1 billion shares, compared with the 6.6 billion-share average over the last 20 trading days.

business,"By Reuters SEOUL/SINGAPORE — Investors in global chipmakers have had a rocky ride in the last few months on worries about a slowing smartphone market, but a clamour for more video content from consumers is underpinning buoyant sales for memory-chip makers. Indeed, the earnings reports of various chipmakers and smartphone companies in the past month tell a more interesting story beyond the cooling in phone shipment volumes: smartphone makers are cramming their devices with memory to satisfy the increasing demands of consumers.  A case in point is last week's quarterly report from Apple Inc. The Cupertino, California-based company said the iPhone X was the most popular iPhone model in the March quarter - the first cycle ever where the costliest iPhone was also the most sought after.  More upbeat assessments from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Qualcomm Inc , and Franco-Italian company STMicroelectronics, have also eased concerns. Samsung last month forecast strong sales for ""high-density"" chips that have more processing power and bigger storage capacity - demand that will help it weather a decline in overall smartphone shipments as consumers are willing to pay for costlier and faster models that allow them to easily watch and store large amounts of video. ""Even as the number of smartphone shipments slow down, each smartphone will contain memory chips with bigger capacity and better performance, which, for memory chip makers, makes up for a slowdown in the number of total smartphones,"" said Kim Rok-ho, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment. That puts into perspective a warning by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) of softer smartphone sales, which was partly responsible for the recent selloff in Apple and other chipmakers. The broader concerns about a slowdown in the chip market appear to have eased as well.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, a proxy for global chipmakers that fell sharply from its peak in mid-March on initial iPhone sales concerns, has stabilized in the past two weeks, posting a 4.4 percent rise so far this year. PURE-PLAY MEMORY  The $122 billion memory chip industry enjoyed an unprecedented boom since mid-2016, expanding nearly 70 percent in 2017 alone, thanks to robust growth of smartphones and cloud services that require more powerful chips that can store loads of data.  The pace of growth is set to more than halve as memory-chip prices come off their highs, but the outlook remains strong for pure-play memory chipmakers such as Micron Technology Inc and SK Hynix. Micron's shares have risen 18 percent this year and Hynix's stock has gained 8.5 percent.  Revenue at Micron, for instance, has grown at an average rate of about 65 percent in the two quarters it has reported this year, and analysts expect it to grow at an average of 30 percent for the rest of the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Micron and Hynix both trade at roughly 4 times forward 12-month earnings against a sector median of 16.7, suggesting that the stocks have room to grow.  Other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Texas Instruments, which are less leveraged to the smartphone market, including those that sell to carmakers, industrial, bitcoin, and gaming companies are well set up too. PROCESSOR CHIPS VULNERABLE All the same, the slowdown in smartphone shipments is bad news for chipmakers that design microprocessors: each phone needs just one microprocessor chip versus rapid growth of memory content in devices.  Global smartphone shipments fell 2 percent in the first quarter, following a 9 percent drop in the fourth quarter, according to market research firm StrategyAnalytics. Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon processors power many popular smartphone models, recently showed just how far it is willing to go to hedge against a slowdown after revenue from its key licensing business slumped 44 percent in the latest quarter. The company, which charges a fee for its chip patents based on a percentage of the selling price of a smartphone, said it would cap the phone price used to calculate that fee at $400. More expensive phones, which can sell for $1,000, would still be treated as $400 for the purpose of the Qualcomm license fee.  TSMC, whose fortunes are more closely tied with the broader smartphone industry as it is the world's largest contract chipmaker, felt the slowdown more acutely in the latest quarter. Qualcomm and TSMC stocks are down 21 percent and 2.6 percent respectively so far this year.  ""The spending cycle (by chipmakers for investment) is continuing, but there may still be volatility similar to the correction in 2015,"" Tammy Qiu, an analyst at Berenberg said in a note to clients.

business,"Economic Scene By Eduardo Porter How low must unemployment go for workers to get a raise? A couple of decades ago, it was normal for workers to get regular pay increases. After declining mercilessly since the early 1970s, the hourly pay of private-sector production and nonsupervisory workers — nurses, cashiers, manufacturing workers on the shop floor and such — hit bottom in 1995 and rose by more than a tenth in real terms over the following eight years. Wages improved up and down the scale as the economy hit full employment. The hourly wage of workers at the bottom tenth of the income distribution rose 11 percent from 1995 to 2000, according to the Economic Policy Institute. It rose almost 8 percent for workers in the middle. Raises are again in the cards. After a long stretch of headlines about stubbornly low wage growth, pay has perked up as the unemployment rate has dipped to levels not seen since the dot-com boom. The median weekly earnings of full-time workers in the middle of the pay ladder ended last year up 4.5 percent from their nadir in the spring of 2014, after accounting for inflation. Target and even Walmart have granted their workers raises. It is high time: Median weekly earnings are only 3 percent higher in real terms than at the millennium. And yet for all the enthusiasm over the economy’s return to full employment, the pay increases of the halcyon 1990s are probably not coming back anytime soon. For one thing, the economic pie is growing more slowly — held in check by lackluster investment, stunted business dynamism and low productivity growth. What’s more, changes in the American economy that stretch back decades — from globalization and automation to the outsourcing of low-paid work and the rise of dominant companies — have deprived workers of leverage. This suggests a double challenge for the nation’s workers. For starters, the American economy needs to recover some of its lost dynamism. For workers to reap a larger share of the spoils of growth, they must claw back the bargaining power they lost. While the goal doesn’t seem impossible, it requires pushing back against a view that has dominated economic policy over the last half century: that government should not stand in the way of corporate America’s forward march, and definitely not mess with its efforts to lower labor costs. On Tuesday, the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution released a series of studies by some of the nation’s top economic thinkers on policies to revitalize wage growth. The good news is that plausible reforms could start tipping the labor market to benefit workers. But bringing the labor market back into balance will require a lot of them. Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggests that to begin with, policymakers could do more to keep labor markets tight. He argues that the Federal Reserve has worried too much about inflation and not enough about the lid it puts on workers’ well-being when it raises interest rates to slow growth. Since 1980, he estimates, the job market has suffered from slack 70 percent of the time — periods when workers, rather than employers, are scrambling. That compares with only a third of the time from 1949 to 1980. To keep it closer to full employment, he proposes a set of policies, including raising the Fed’s inflation target from its current 2 percent, creating a fund to bolster job creation in moments of slack and engaging the government in job creation. And yet, as Mr. Bernstein acknowledges, tight labor markets are only part of the solution. For starters, they eventually end when the cycle turns — and wages can get stuck for a long time. And tight labor markets don’t carry the power they used to. A 1999 study by the economists Lawrence Katz of Harvard University and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton University estimated how far the unemployment rate needed to decline to prevent wages from falling. From the mid-1970s to the late ’80s, they found, an unemployment rate of 6.2 percent or lower would keep wages at the bottom tenth of the pay scale from declining. By the 1990s, however, unemployment had to dip to 5.7 percent to prevent wage losses at the bottom. Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute replicated the exercise for the economic expansion that ended with the demise of the housing bubble in 2007: Unemployment, he found, had to fall below 4.6 percent to keep workers in the bottom 10 percent from losing ground. At this pace, unemployment will soon have to hit zero for workers at the bottom to get a raise. So what else can be done? There is obviously a role for training and education to help workers meet employers’ rising demand for skills, especially at the beginning of their career. Fatih Guvenen of the University of Minnesota notes that the income of 25-year-old men starting their careers has declined sharply since the early 1970s and is now about where it was in the late ’50s. But a strategy focused on education will not tip the balance. As Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute points out, the list of remedies is long. It includes raising the minimum wage, increasing unionization, banning mandatory arbitration for employment claims, ending arbitrary and unpredictable scheduling, and ensuring that companies that subcontract their low-wage work remain in some way accountable for the workers. Or how about restoring competition to labor markets? Mr. Krueger and Eric Posner of the University of Chicago write that the government could stop companies from forcing low-pay workers to sign noncompete covenants, which bar them from better-paid jobs elsewhere. It should also ban no-poaching arrangements of dubious legality among franchisees of the same company, which also close off workers’ options. Over the last 50 years, employers have been allowed to exercise ever more sway over their workers. The share of private-sector workers covered by unions has dwindled to a sliver. Businesses have grown to imposing heft. All along, executives and policymakers have sold this rebalancing of power as a boon for competitiveness, efficiency and economic growth. And yet unbalanced labor markets not only hold back wages but also stymie the American economy as a whole. As Mr. Krueger pointed out to me, a rigged labor market is not efficient. Barring anti-competitive hiring practices will increase economic efficiency and encourage both higher wages and more employment. Better training will improve workers’ productivity, but so will helping them relocate to better operations. Rebalancing the labor relationship might not only improve the way the pie is shared but also make it bigger.

business,"By Michael Gold Walmart customers looking to toss the latest issue of Cosmopolitan magazine into their shopping carts will have to search the superstore a little harder. The retailer has decided to remove the magazine from its checkout aisle displays in its 5,000-plus stores in the United States, in a move announced by a nonprofit anti-pornography group that connected the company’s decision to the #MeToo movement. The magazines will be placed on racks elsewhere, varying by store. The April issue features Cardi B, the reality star turned rapper, who gives an “uncensored and totally amazing” interview inside. Other headlines promise tips on sex toys and foreplay, the secrets of super-close couples and this teaser: “Could you be guilty of micro-cheating? Could he?” Walmart, in a statement, acknowledged that “the concerns raised were heard” but said that its decision stemmed from business reasons. “As with all products in our store, we continue to evaluate our assortment and make changes,” the statement said. When asked for further comment, Walmart indicated that there are a number of factors it evaluates when making in-store placement decisions, including customer feedback and sales data. Nevertheless, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an advocacy group that has campaigned against what it calls Cosmopolitan’s “hyper-sexualized and sexually objectifying” content, took some credit for the move on Tuesday, citing its “collaborative dialogue” with Walmart. “This is what real change looks like in our #MeToo culture,” said Dawn Hawkins, the group’s executive director, in a statement. A Cosmopolitan spokesman declined to directly address the group’s description but emphasized the publication’s focus on female empowerment. “We are proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world in the areas of equality, health, relationships, career, politics and social issues,” he said in a statement. The magazine, which will still be available for purchase on periodical racks on Walmart stores, has been a focus of the nonprofit group for years. In 2015, the organization started a campaign to get stores to shield Cosmopolitan’s headlines and covers behind blinders or wraps similar to those that frequently cover pornographic material. At that time, it worked with Victoria Hearst, the granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst, who founded Cosmopolitan’s publisher, the Hearst Group. The joint effort appeared to be successful. Ms. Hearst, who now runs a “Cosmo Hurts Kids” campaign aimed at stopping the sale of the magazine to children under 18, was not involved in the center’s current push, according to according to Haley Halverson, the organization’s vice president for advocacy and outreach. The group, which was founded in 1962 and was previously known as Morality in Media, has continued to focus on Cosmopolitan in part, Ms. Halverson said, because the magazine was “targeting young girls” with its messaging. “A young teenager who first picks up Cosmo is going to be attracted to the bubble gum pink cover and to stories about Selena Gomez and One Direction,” Ms. Halverson said. “But within the covers, Cosmo is filled with extremely explicit articles that detail things like sexting, pornography, group sex, public sex and other forms of risky sex that actually a lot of young girls today are being pressured to do before they’re ready.” Ms. Halverson also said the group viewed its efforts as especially important in the midst of the continuing conversation around sexual harassment that was sparked by the #MeToo movement. “Cosmopolitan really likes to wrap itself up in its faux feminist mystique where they’re claiming that because they’re talking about sex, it’s liberating to women,” she said. “But it’s time to raise the level of discourse and say, ‘Well, are they talking about sex in an actually empowering or productive way?’” When asked, Ms. Halverson could not think of an example of a publication or media organization discussing sexuality in the manner she described. The statement linking Cosmopolitan to #MeToo culture was met with some skepticism online. The magazine has written multiple articles about the #MeToo movement, as well as the sexual assault and consent issues at its center. In an article for Vogue, Michelle Ruiz, a former sex and relationships editor at Cosmopolitan, wrote that the publication has long advocated for consensual adult sex and has recently shifted its focus to women’s sexual pleasure. John Harrington, a publishing industry consultant who until 2015 published a newsletter covering the magazine business, linked Walmart’s decision to larger trends. As magazine sales continue to decline, Mr. Harrington said, it was likely that Cosmopolitan’s sales at Walmart were following that trend. But he also said that the retailer historically had appeared more responsive than other retailers to pressure from outside groups. In the past, “they have occasionally moved magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour on an issue-by-issue basis,” Mr. Harrington said. In 2003, Walmart announced plans to obscure the covers of those two publications, as well as Redbook and Marie Claire. That same year, its stores also stopped selling the men’s magazines Maxim, Stuff and FHM after pressure from Christian groups.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
business,"By Brooks Barnes CULVER CITY, Calif. — It was as if they were stepping into 1940, the heart of Hollywood’s golden age. The stucco bungalow where Orson Welles puffed on his pipe between “Citizen Kane” scenes shimmered in the sun. White roses bloomed along a path leading to the cottage where Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh changed into their “Gone With the Wind” costumes. You half expected Cecil B. DeMille to come bounding out of the nearby studio administration building, a mansion modeled after Mount Vernon, to bawl out an underling. Yet a gathering here last week was not about Hollywood’s past as much as its future. The official purpose was to commemorate the $12 million restoration of four studio buildings. But the visitors may as well have come to cut the ribbon on a new era in the entertainment industry — one marked by the ascent of streaming giants like Amazon Studios, the compound’s new tenant. “This historic place has become newly relevant,” a beaming Jeffrey Cooper, Culver City’s mayor, told the crowd as Jennifer Salke, the Amazon Studios chief, sliced a green-and-white sash with gargantuan scissors. “So exciting!” Ms. Salke said, shaking Mr. Cooper’s hand. Two of her Amazon Studios lieutenants, Albert Cheng and Jason Ropell, clapped nearby. Amazon is only renting Culver Studios, as the 14-acre lot is called. Hackman Capital Partners, a real estate investment company, has owned the rectangular property since 2014 and lured Amazon with a plan to spend $600 million on seven new studio buildings and other upgrades by 2021. But Amazon’s decision to move its entertainment division to the compound under a 15-year lease — the company had been using nondescript offices in Santa Monica — demonstrates the degree to which the tech giants have woven themselves into the fabric of Hollywood. You can no longer separate one from the other. “This is mixing old media and new media in a completely harmonious way,” Michael Hackman, chief executive of Hackman Capital Partners, said by phone on Wednesday. The majestic administration building, for instance, looks much as it did in the 1930s and ’40s, when DeMille and David O. Selznick, who produced “Gone With the Wind,” had their offices inside. Only now, the movies in the framed posters hanging inside “the mansion,” as the building is known in film circles, are owned by Amazon, including “Manchester by the Sea,” “The Handmaiden” and “The Big Sick.” “I like the sense of history because it holds us to a standard,” Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, said when a reporter asked him about the Culver Studios move at an Oscar-season cocktail party. Culver Studios may have a grand past — “Raging Bull” and “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” were made here, along with the pilot for the original “Star Trek” television series — but the complex also epitomizes the troubles the movie business has encountered over the decades. As a string of owners struggled to adapt to changing audience tastes, new technology and rising costs, vast sections of the campus were sold. (Condominiums now occupy part of the area where Selznick ignited monumental outdoor sets to simulate the burning of Atlanta.) As waves of consolidation buffeted the movie business and fewer films were made, idling some of Culver Studios’ stages, the facility turned to television production to pay its bills, much like Hollywood as a whole. By 2004, when a struggling Sony sold the property, years of underinvestment had taken a toll. The old star bungalows were in poor repair. Soundstages were outdated. The mansion smelled like Grandma’s house. “It needed a lot of work, to say the least,” Mr. Hackman said. (Contrary to popular belief, the mansion was not Tara in “Gone With the Wind.”) Amazon, which has roughly 700 entertainment employees, began moving staff here late last year. More will follow as buildings are completed. “It’s about recognizing the traditions and legacy of Hollywood, while also recognizing that we have the ability to reshape it,” Mr. Cheng, chief operating officer of Amazon Studios, said of the decision to make Culver Studios the unit’s headquarters. Last month, Amazon said it would also lease a four-story building that is going up across the street, giving its Hollywood division a total of 355,000 square feet of office space in Culver City. (Apple recently leased a building three blocks away for its own original content group.) Amazon revealed Wednesday that more than 100 million people globally had a Prime membership, which includes access to its streaming service, and the company is expected to spend $5 billion on movies and television programming this year, according to the J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth. Its 44 original series include “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” and “The Man in the High Castle.” Amazon has at least 10 movies in various stages of production, including “Life Itself,” a highly anticipated romance set for release on Sept. 21. The streaming-service boom has given other old, independently owned soundstage facilities a new lease on life. Bookings have spiked at the Lot, a 1920s-era compound that once belonged to United Artists; Amazon has rented it for shows like “The Last Tycoon” and “Goliath.” Hulu is using Sunset Gower Studios, vacated by Columbia Pictures in 1972, to tape “I Love You, America,” starring Sarah Silverman. A few years ago, there was no sadder movie property in Los Angeles than Sunset Bronson Studios, a dilapidated 10-stage facility that Warner Bros. occupied until decamping for Burbank in 1930. Last year, Netflix moved onto that lot, attracted by $200 million in upgrades and a new, 14-story office tower. Another five-story building for Netflix is under construction at Sunset Bronson, which is owned by Hudson Pacific. But nothing quite matches the restoration of Culver Studios, in part because Hackman Capital has paid lavish attention to detail. “They even took pains to recreate the same texture and color of the cement,” said Margarita Jerabek, director of historic resources at ESA, a planning firm involved in the project. She pointed to steps leading into the bungalow once used by Gable and Leigh as a dressing room. That white structure, notable for its green shutters and bordered by a tightly clipped lawn, sits just outside the 99-year-old mansion, which was built by Thomas Ince, a silent-film innovator whose 1924 death was suspicious. According to “Movie Studios of Culver City,” a 2011 book by the historians Julie Lugo Cerra and Marc Wanamaker, people have long reported sightings of Ince’s ghost on the property. “I personally have not seen him yet,” Mr. Cheng said. “But I’m sure he’s happy. We plan to take very good care of our new home.”    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
