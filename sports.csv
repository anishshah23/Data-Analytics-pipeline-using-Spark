sports,"By Sopan Deb When Camille Cosby, the wife of Bill Cosby, issued a scathing statement on Thursday denouncing the verdict that found her husband guilty of sexual assault, she painted him as a casualty of an unfair, racist system. She blamed the media, the prosecution and the victim, and then made a comparison to one of the nation’s most infamous crimes. “Since when are all accusers truthful?” Mrs. Cosby said. “History disproves that. For example, Emmett Till’s accuser immediately comes to mind.” It was the second time in a week that a member of Bill Cosby’s inner circle linked him to Till, and while the comment drew immediate backlash, it was merely the most recent invocation of Till’s name as analogue. Beyond its impact on the civil rights movement, Till’s memory has inspired protesters, historians and documentarians to the present day; endured in popular culture as a synonym for injustice; and occasionally rekindled anger when used in unexpected ways. Airickca Gordon-Taylor, a cousin of Till, said in a phone interview on Thursday that Mrs. Cosby’s comments were in “poor taste.” “You’ve got apples and you have oranges and there’s nothing about either situation that is in alignment with the other,” said Ms. Gordon-Taylor, the head of the Mamie Till Mobley Memorial Foundation, named after Till’s mother. In 1955, Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago, was visiting relatives in Jim Crow-era Mississippi when, witnesses said, he whistled at a white woman named Carolyn Bryant Donham. It was never clear whether Till actually whistled, but the truth mattered little: Four days later, he was kidnapped from his great-uncle’s home, beaten, tortured and shot. His body was then dumped in the Tallahatchie River. Two men were arrested — Roy Bryant, Ms. Donham’s husband, and his half brother, J.W. Milam — but they were acquitted of murder by an all-white jury. Later, both men admitted to the crime in an interview with Look Magazine, but could not be retried because of the law’s double-jeopardy protections. Till’s mother wanted an open coffin at his funeral so people could see what had happened to her boy, and a photograph of her agony became a catalyst for the civil rights movement. Till’s story received renewed attention in the 1980s, in part because of a documentary that aired on a Chicago television station, “The Murder and the Movement.” In the years since, Till has been the subject of several books, including one by his mother, and more documentaries. In 2004, the F.B.I. reopened the investigation into Till’s case to explore whether anyone could be charged. No one was. Last year Timothy B. Tyson, a Duke University professor and author of the 2017 book “The Blood of Emmett Till,” revealed that Ms. Donham had told him that one account she had given in front of the judge in her husband’s case — that Till had grabbed her and was menacing — was false. Some commenters on Twitter have suggested that if Mr. Cosby could be prosecuted for a sexual assault that occurred more than a decade ago, Ms. Donham should face prosecution as well. In recent years, Till’s name has frequently been used in discussions of unarmed black men and boys shot dead by police or, in the case of Trayvon Martin, by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, who ultimately was acquitted. “It’s not just a conceptual overlap between Trayvon, Black Lives Matter and Emmett Till, but a very personal overlap,” said Dave Tell, a professor at the University of Kansas who has studied Till extensively. “The Till family is very close to the family of Trayvon Martin. They see Emmett Till as the protohistory of the Black Lives Matter movement.” He added: “We’re at a moment right now where more are talking about Emmett Till than has been the case in 60-plus years.” Some prominent writers have sought to tamp down the Martin and Till comparisons. Eugene Robinson, a columnist for The Washington Post, wrote in 2012: “To make a facile comparison is a disservice to history — and to the memory of both young men. It is ridiculous to imply that nothing has changed.” Eric Holder, who was attorney general when a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., fatally shot Michael Brown in 2014, compared Mr. Brown’s death to Till’s at an event in Washington where a tree was planted in Till’s memory. “There is an enduring legacy that Emmett Till has left with us that we still have to confront as a nation,” Mr. Holder said. Every corner of pop culture has lamented the Till tragedy, from Bob Dylan, who sang “The Death of Emmett Till” in 1962, to the rapper Rick Ross, who referenced Till on his 2010 track, “Tears Of Joy.” The comedian Dave Chappelle compared Till’s death to President Trump’s election as potential catalysts for change in his recent Netflix special, “Equanimity.” A short film about Till’s case, “My Nephew Emmett,” told from the perspective of the great-uncle whose home Till was taken from, was nominated for an Oscar this year. When the N.B.A. star LeBron James had a racial slur painted on the front of his home in Los Angeles last year, he talked about Till. “I think back to Emmett Till’s mom actually, and the reason that she had an open casket is because she wanted to show the world what her son went through as far as a hate crime and being black in America,” Mr. James said. The image of Till’s coffin has become its own reference point transcending race. When the mother of Noah Pozner, one of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, laid him to rest in an open coffin with a cloth covering the place his jawline should have been,  she said, “I just want people to know the ugliness of it so we don’t talk about it abstractly, like these little angels just went to heaven.” Gun control supporters made the comparison to Till’s mother. But some invocations, like Mrs. Cosby’s, have been questionable. In 2013, the rapper Lil Wayne used Till’s name as a metaphor in a vulgar sexual lyric, lost a Pepsi endorsement and subsequently apologized to Till’s family. In his debut single in 2004, “Through The Wire,” Kanye West compared his own face after a car accident to that of Till in his coffin, and Till remained in Mr. West’s lexicon in 2010 when he compared the fallout after his infamous MTV Video Music Awards outburst against Taylor Swift to “a neo-Emmett Till.” And others have triggered criticism even when they intended to pay tribute: When a white artist, Dana Schutz, displayed her painting of Till’s open coffin at the Whitney Biennial last year, she was accused of cultural appropriation. “Emmett Till is just packed all in our heads,” said Clenora Hudson-Weems, a professor at the University of Missouri and the author of “Emmett Till: The Sacrificial Lamb of the Civil Rights Movement.” “We can’t get rid of it. It’s in our heads. It has indelibly impacted our American culture.” But for the Till family, his death is more than just a cultural landmark. “I just hope that when people speak about Emmett in certain contexts, they need to remember that there are people who are still alive in my family that suffered and survived that horrific incident,” his cousin, Ms. Gordon-Taylor, said. “They were in the house when that happened — I still have loved ones who relive that in their minds.” Follow Sopan Deb on Twitter:@SopanDeb.

Can culture explain a nation’s success at racing around a hockey rink (and archery and women’s golf and e-sports and breakdancing)?
 
By JAY CASPIAN KANGIllustration by TATSURO KIUCHI
MARCH 6, 2018
 We Koreans, my father once argued, have thicker legs than our Asian neighbors, a trait that comes with athletic benefits and drawbacks. Big legs are good for short bursts, but the added muscle weight leads to stamina issues. This was in 1992, and my father, a chemist who tended to see things in terms of inputs and outputs, was explaining why our home country, South Korea, which had never meaningfully competed in the Winter Olympics, had won a handful of medals in short-track speedskating. (A decade later, he would revise this theory for our run to the semifinals of the World Cup in soccer. We had finally found a manager, he said, who understood genetics.) In the 26 years since then, Koreans have come to dominate other things, many of them unrelated to innate leg strength. We rule the world in women’s golf, e-sports, break dancing, drinking (by volume of shots per week) and archery. The specificity of these pursuits has led to wild speculation among the diaspora about why we’re so good at such random sports. We might not actually want to know the answer. The most sensible and palatable explanation, of course, is economic. “In the ’80s and ’90s, the national athletic association was looking for Olympic sports that Koreans could do well in,” the anonymous writer behind the influential blog “Ask a Korean!” told me. “They decided to focus on short track because it was a relatively new event.” Skating programs opened up at every rink; high schools and universities started sponsoring teams. A national infrastructure was built. Korea, in effect, cornered a new medals market. But a more compelling, if troubling, reason for Korean short-track domination might be glimpsed, oddly enough, in “Planet B-Boy,” a 2008 documentary about international break-dancing culture. In one memorable scene, the Gamblerz, at the time the Yankees of break dancing, are rehearsing in their studio in Seoul. As the dancers contort and invert their bodies, you see that break dancing, which must look stylishly effortless, is actually created by brute strength and technical repetition. A Gambler named Still explains why his teammate Laser became the best head spinner in the world. “Laser has spent the past five or six years spinning on his head,” Still says matter-of-factly. “He doesn’t really do anything else, and to be honest, he’s not that good at any other moves.” Koreans, in other words, are really good at repetition. “Everyone has a theory about why Koreans are dominant at short track,” Simon Cho, a retired Korean-American skater who competed in the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, told me. “What it really comes down to is early discipline — Korean skaters are technically trained from a very early age.” This was a life Cho knew intimately as an immigrant whose family moved to the States when he was a young boy. His father saw the growing Korean success in short track and put his son in skates when he was 3. As Cho progressed, he was coached by a series of Korean coaches accustomed to a ruthless national athletic program that winnowed down a vast pool of young skaters through a steady diet of corporal punishment and repetition that set the hips deeper into crouches, the shoulders leaning at the correct angle, the thighs pumping with precision. Cho was beaten with hockey sticks and forced to run endless laps by his Korean coaches, and when he was ultimately suspended from the sport for tampering with a Canadian competitor’s blade, he said his Korean coach had put him up to it. Those Korean coaches who showed up in the States in the ’90s and ’00s brought with them an idea of competition forged through decades of rapid economic development after a war that destroyed the country and ripped families apart. “That period in history made Koreans an overzealously proud people,” Benson Lee, the director of “Planet B-Boy,” says. “That competitiveness comes from this idea of han — a deep-rooted desire to be a contender because of missed opportunities and being driven to succeed because you suffered so much.” Immigrants tend to cling to these sorts of cultural explanations, perhaps out of unrequited homesickness. We second-generation immigrants who see our motherlands only through spectacles like Olympic competitions are usually disappointed by the realities behind them. But that’s what allows a hybrid identity to emerge, one more attuned to our new homes. Cho believes that he — or really any American skater — would not have been able to compete on the world stage without Korean instruction, but he also believes there’s another way. He now coaches in Maryland; many of his skaters are the kids of second-generation Korean-Americans who were brought up in the States. Some have been punished in the old ways by previous coaches, but others are only vaguely aware of what Cho and his generation of skaters experienced. Parents “would be horrified if I coached their kids the way I was coached,” Cho says. “That’s gotta be progress, right?” Jay Caspian Kang is a writer at large for the magazine.

sports,"By Dave Itzkoff If “Saturday Night Live” suffered any loss of visibility during its monthlong Winter Olympics hiatus, the show got a most unusual promotional boost on Friday. That’s when President Trump, a frequent target of “S.N.L.” and a once-vocal critic of the show, broke a monthslong silence and went on Twitter to vent his spleen at Alec Baldwin, his “S.N.L.” impersonator. A complete rundown of the Trump-Baldwin spat can be found here, but to quickly summarize, Baldwin in an interview on Thursday said that every time he plays the president now, “it’s like agony,” adding that “we have to get rid of him.” In response, Trump tweeted that Baldwin’s “dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me” and that it was “agony for those who were forced to watch.” Baldwin then followed with a series of tweets in which he mused, among other things, that he’d like to stick around in the role long enough “for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride” to Mar-a-Lago. This weekend’s broadcast of “S.N.L.,” hosted by Charles Barkley and featuring the musical guest Migos, didn’t directly acknowledge the feud, though it did give Baldwin plenty of airtime to lampoon the president in its opening sketch. In what purported to be another presidential listening session on gun control, Baldwin (as Trump) led off by addressing the audience: “Tonight I am here to bring you a message of healing and a show of unity,” he said as he looked at his notes. “I hear you and I care. Rent ‘Lego Ninjago Movie.’ Sorry, Eric scribbled some notes on there, too.” After contemplating the idea of taking guns away from all Americans — “even whites”— Baldwin went on to address the latest personnel losses in the Trump administration. Paying homage to Hope Hicks, the outgoing White House communications director, Baldwin said: “She’s like a daughter to me. So smart, so hot. You know, I hate seeing her go but I love watching her walk away.” In her absence, Baldwin said, “Jared Kushner’s basically the hottest chick left in the place.” And when he sought assurance from Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, that he was still on board, the camera cut to an empty chair with McMaster’s name in front of it. Turning to the subject of tariffs, Baldwin said: “Both sides hated it. I don’t care. I said I was going to run this country like a business. That business is a Waffle House at 2 a.m. Crazies everywhere, staff walking out in the middle of their shift, managers taking money out of the cash register to pay off the Russian mob.” In other highlights from the episode: Though he occasionally stumbled in his delivery, Barkley, the “Inside the NBA” analyst, scored with a pointed comedic commentary on the role of athletes in American civic life. He began: I’m an athlete, and athletes have been speaking out a lot this year. They’ve been kneeling during the anthem, refusing to go to the White House, and a lot of professional athletes are worried about speaking out might hurt their career. Well, here’s something that contradicts all of that: me. I’ve been saying whatever the hell I want for 30 years, and I’m doing great. I’m hosting “S.N.L.” for the fourth time, for no reason. Lorne Michaels just wanted somebody to talk to about “Black Panther.” But this country’s had a great tradition of athletes speaking their minds. Muhammad Ali changed the way people thought about Vietnam. Jim Brown had people thinking about race. Michael Jordan even thought it was O.K. for humans to play with Looney Tunes. Alluding to the Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s recent criticism of LeBron James, Barkley added: Well, some folks think we’re all spoiled millionaires. But athletes work hard. … But some people don’t want to hear from professional athletes. Like this lady on Fox News who told LeBron James to shut up and dribble. And dribbling’s like LeBron’s only fourth thing he’s good at. Shooting, passing, and magically making his hairline come back. But the media does this stuff all the time. I went to President Obama’s 50th birthday party. They got video of me, Jay-Z, Steve Harvey and Grant Hill at the party, and Fox News called it a “hip-hop barbecue.” First of all, we were the only four black people there. And three of us ain’t even in hip-hop. So calling it a hip-hop barbecue is like calling any tournament Tiger [Woods] plays in “Def Golf Jam.” At the conclusion of his monologue, Barkley traded riffs with the “Weekend Update” co-anchor Michael Che. “I’m proud to stand for the anthem,” Barkley said. “Unless Fergie is singing it, and I just fall over laughing.” Che responded: “I stay seated for the anthem, because I’m still in my Uber. Because black people are always late.” On the night before the Oscars, “S.N.L.” imagined a far more scathing (if timely) event called the Grabbies, presented by the Academy of Sexual Harassment and Misconduct in Hollywood and dedicated, as an announcer described, to “celebrating this year’s worst behavior in entertainment.” Its categories include Handsiest Actor, Best Animated Grope, Worst Thing Done to a Plant and the coveted Cecil B. Molestin’ Lifetime Achievement Award, as well as Most Open Robe. Previewing his possible awards speech, an actor played by Pete Davidson said: “Well, first, I’d like to thank guns for pivoting the national conversation away from harassment. I’d also like to thank my uncle for always saying, ‘Boys will be boys.’ Even when it was, like, O.J.” Playing the soon-to-be departed Hope Hicks, Cecily Strong recalled her time at the Trump White House as if it were summer camp. “You make all these new friends,” she explained. “You barely get any sleep and then everybody leaves after eight weeks.” She bid farewell to friends like Kellyanne Conway (“You taught me that a strong woman can run a campaign and win. And you showed me what I could turn into if I stick around too long”), and in a final message to her colleagues, she said: “I’ll see you guys at the reunion in 10 years. Seven with good behavior.” “S.N.L.” cast member Leslie Jones, who provided running commentary on the Winter Olympics both in person and over Twitter, spoke to the “Weekend Update” co-anchor Colin Jost about her time in Pyeongchang. “I am a six-foot black woman,” Jones told him. “You think I stand out in America? Everybody in Korea was 4-foot-1. They either thought I was an athlete or a guy. Some of them thought I was a Transformer, but Transformers don’t eat Korean barbecue like that.” At the end of her segment, Jones brought out Hilary Knight, a member of the United States’ gold-medal winning women’s hockey team, and gave Jost a warning. “Don’t be talking about how you’re going to teach me something,” Jones said. “I got friends who are gold-medal Olympians.”     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
sports,"Scene City  16 Photos View Slide Show › Jackie Molloy for The New York Times By Ben Detrick Philipp Plein’s rave on Saturday night, in a gargantuan Brooklyn Navy Yard hangar, was a Winter Olympics-meets-“Barbarella” extravaganza. There were rappers, drifts of artificial snow and a smoke-belching U.F.O. that descended from the ceiling. “I’ve partied here before,” said Joakim Noah, the New York Knicks center, who stripped to an undershirt in a V.I.P. area. “But I’ve never seen it like this.”  17 Photos View Slide Show › Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times Spectacle, arriviste or not, was a rarity this New York Fashion Week. Party heavyweights like Alexander Wang, Rihanna, Public School and Purple magazine were absent from the social calendar. Others found smaller confines: Opening Ceremony hosted a Barragán party at the Standard High Line, Garage magazine parked in the Gramercy Park Hotel’s Rose Bar, and Last magazine hermit-crabbed into a Brooklyn beer hall with Burberry. New York Fashion Week is both a corporate-fueled vehicle and a fractured vessel in a shifting industry. Brands are moving off-calendar, debuting lines on Instagram and decamping to European cities. Is the late-night scene slipping through the cracks?  11 Photos View Slide Show › Rebecca Smeyne for The New York Times “You can’t have these giant parties and go back to something small,” said Paul Sevigny, the D.J. and impresario behind Paul’s Cocktail Lounge in TriBeCa, which will host an intimate event for Calvin Klein. “Fashion week used to be for people who were involved in fashion, not your Googles.” Mr. Wang’s show was also on Saturday. Instead of unfurling a #Wangfest with Kardashians, Cardi B and Dunkin’ Donut towers, as he did in September, he and his retinue ended up at the Brooklyn Bazaar in Greenpoint for a dance party hosted by the Lot Radio, an internet station that operates from a shipping container.  12 Photos View Slide Show › Amy Lombard for The New York Times There, Brian Procell, who runs a vintage boutique specializing in 1990s paraphernalia, suggested designers were rebelling against the fashion week grind. “It makes more sense not to follow these schedules,” he said. “Azzedine Alaïa was the first outlier for how people act now. Kanye is just going to do his thing when he’s ready.” Some parties were bolstered by ties to pop culture. On Monday, film and fashion gathered for a charity collection inspired by “Black Panther” at Industria in the West Village. Lupita Nyong’o, who stars in the movie, walked the red carpet; Heron Preston D.J.ed; and fashion designers unveiled their looks. Ruth Gruca, the global fashion director of Made, said it felt like a slow week, party-wise. “February fashion week is a little irrelevant,” she said, as she was leaving to check out the Barragán event nearby. “New York is kind of in fluctuation. A lot of brands are showing in Paris because that’s where the commerce happens.” Later, at Terminal 5 in Hell’s Kitchen, VFiles and Adidas Originals went experimental, marrying a live photo shoot with a party. As tunes from Lil Uzi Vert and Crime Mob blared, models sat for makeup on the stage and posed in front of white backdrops and lighting umbrellas. Nats Getty, a designer, activist and artist, praised the spontaneity of VFiles’ multidimensional format. “I love it,” she said. “It’s in the moment. That’s how everything should be. It’s genius.” The week’s most distinctly homegrown event took place on Friday, when the designer Telfar Clemens threw an after-party at Century 21, the discount department store in the financial district. Fashionable guests including Kelela, Maluca and Raul Zepol filled up several floors of the cleared-out store as drum-and-bass clattered. “l have a lot of roots here,” Mr. Clemens said. “I went to Pace University. I would come here in between classes to find everything designer that I couldn’t afford.” Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
sports,"New York Today By Alexandra S. Levine Good morning on this bright Wednesday. Snow last week. 30s and drizzly yesterday. 50s and somewhat cloudy today. 70s and splendid by week’s end. New York weather can be baffling this time of year, but if you listen to your body, it may be able to tell you what’s in store. “Your body can, in some ways, predict an upcoming change in the weather because of barometric pressure,” or the weight of the atmosphere, said Dr. Jaspal Singh, co-director of the Weill Cornell Medicine Center for Comprehensive Spine Care on the Upper East Side. The knowledge is in your joints. Meteorologists look at changes in atmospheric pressure to forecast weather patterns. Our joints, Dr. Singh explained, respond to those changes, too. At normal or higher pressure, when the atmosphere is heavier, it pushes against us from the outside, preventing our body tissue from expanding. But as atmospheric pressure drops — as it does ahead of damp, rainy or snowy weather — body tissue has more space to expand. When it does, it can push against our joints, causing some people, especially those with injuries or arthritis, to feel aches and pains. Our bodies have a harder time sensing when a brilliant day is coming. On days when the pressure is average, your joints likely wouldn’t hurt, so if the pressure were to rise, there would be no change for the body to feel, Dr. Singh said. But the sun is here to stay through Saturday. The weatherman says so.

Fifty years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1968, considered our last major piece of civil rights legislation. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated just one week earlier, and riots were ravaging the country. “PRESIDENT SIGNS CIVIL RIGHTS BILL; PLEADS FOR CALM,” read the front-page headline of The New York Times. The Fair Housing Act, as it was known, pushed for equality by cracking down on housing discrimination, making it illegal to refuse to rent or sell property to anyone on the basis of “race, color, religion, sex, familial status or national origin.” It also prevented federal spending in ways that would further segregation or racial discrimination. “The time is here. Action must be now,” the president said on that day, reminding members of Congress in attendance that two years earlier, Dr. King had been at the White House meeting in which the housing law was first proposed. You can learn more about the civil rights era and Dr. King’s legacy at “Rebel Spirits,” an exhibition on display at the New-York Historical Society until May 20, and at a lecture there on April 23, “The Supreme Court vs. Martin Luther King Jr.” New York Today is a morning roundup that is published weekdays at 6 a.m. If you don’t get it in your inbox already, you can sign up to receive it by email here.

sports,"New York Today By Jonathan Wolfe Good morning on this damp Friday. With our subways in crisis, advocates are trying to ratchet up political pressure to fix the system by highlighting the most nightmarish journeys. The Riders Alliance’s new “Worst Commute of the Week” award drew these submissions from passengers: • A broken elevator at Herald Square and another at Penn Station meant that Maggie Clarke, 64, a busker from Inwood, had to lug 50 pounds of music equipment up and down an extra four flights of stairs. “Considering the damage the system is doing to my person,” she said, “I need to just suck it up and take a cab.” •  John Rakis, 65, a criminal justice consultant, waited 45 minutes for a southbound R train at City Hall, gave up, caught a northbound R to Canal Street to switch trains, and waited another 35 minutes. At one point he thought to himself, “I left work an hour and a half ago and I’m further away than when I started.” • After a 25-minute wait, Alisa Roost, 46, a professor at CUNY, squeezed onto an uptown A train, whereupon “a laundry cart ran over my feet and someone hit my 13-month old son in the head with his bag.” But the winner of this week’s worst commute award was: • Jennifer Tang 49, a librarian at CUNY from Forest Hills, Queens. She made the mistake of skipping the bathroom on the way home from brunch and found herself stuck in a stalled R only a few feet from her stop at 63rd Drive. “People around me were getting antsy, cursing, and stomping their feet,” she said. “My bladder was bursting and I started panicking.” An hour and 20 minutes later, the train rolled into the station. But enough about bad commutes. We want to hear something positive for a change. Have you had something unexpectedly pleasant happen to you during a recent commute? Witnessed a touching act of humanity, met someone special, saw something that made you smile? Rode a train that got from point A to point B without pausing once? Tell us at nytoday@nytimes.com. Please include your full name, age and the neighborhood or city in which you live. We may include your response in an upcoming New York Today column. Here’s what else is happening: Another cool, drizzly day, with a high around 44. (Wind chill will make it feel between 30 and 35.) The weekend will be warmer — 58 tomorrow, 48 on Sunday — but rain and gray skies will persist. The sun returns on Monday to welcome you back to work. • The jury selection process in the case of a nanny who allegedly murdered two children she was watching has become a microcosm of a split New York, those who can afford a nanny and those who cannot.

sports,"Feature From “Lady Bird” to “Three Tall Women” to a revival of “Roseanne,” the 62-year-old actress is finally showing off the extent of her range. CreditCollier Schorr for The New York Times. Stylist: Mary Inacio. Hair: Christopher Marrero. Makeup: Susie Sobol. Supported by By Willa Paskin A unicorn, a monster, a phoenix, a machine, a heavyweight fighter, an astronaut, a superhero, a thoroughbred, a home-run hitter, a waitress juggling “16 entrees, 42 starters, 16 desserts,” a jazz virtuoso, LeBron James, Magellan, Snuffleupagus. The actress Laurie Metcalf has been compared to all of these things. To speak with her colleagues is to blush on her behalf. It is to hear words like “purity” and “devotion” and “work ethic,” delivered with the sober intonations of people doing all they can to rescue them from cliché. On a Saturday in early February, in a rehearsal space overlooking Times Square, light streaming through the double-height floor-to-ceiling windows, Metcalf was laboring over B, one of the three nameless characters in Edward Albee’s 1994 Pulitzer Prize-winning play, “Three Tall Women.” A restaging, directed by Joe Mantello and co-starring Alison Pill and Glenda Jackson, will open on Broadway in March, and the cast was gathered at the end of the second week of rehearsal. Metcalf, her short dark hair curling around her ears, in a gray cowl-neck sweater and skinny gray jeans that looked baggy on her, deftly glided around the working set — an elderly woman’s bedroom with a small vanity, a love seat, an armchair, a double bed — bracingly awake. She had traded in the Uggs she wore in that morning for a pair of thick-heeled black pumps, part of her costume. “Three Tall Women,” inspired by Albee’s adopted mother, with whom he had a deeply fraught relationship, is a metaphysically complicated play that starts with a conversation between an old woman, A; her health aide, B; and a younger lawyer, C; and becomes an interrogation of identity, memory, personality and time. Despite not having much plot, it has a twist. Metcalf describes it as “slippery.” She is drawn to material that she doesn’t entirely comprehend but that has a mood, a line, a joke, a stage direction that inspires strong emotion in her. “That’s the hook,” she says. “Ninety-seven percent of the play I don’t understand yet, but we’ll figure it out in the room. The other 3 percent I know exactly how to play it and how to help the audience have that initial gut feeling I had when I read it.” In the case of “Three Tall Women,” she was drawn in by the play’s melancholy exploration of aging and the unexpected humor of its bare-bones writing style — like the moment when C says to B, “I imagine I’ll marry and I’ll be very happy,” to which B replies only, “Well.” To Metcalf, that “Well” was full of comedic possibility, a whoopee cushion at a chair convention. In the rehearsal room, Metcalf found dozens of variations on throwaway phrases, energetically and speedily trying out “we know”s and “honestly”s in different registers and moods — furious, intimidating, apologetic, silly, exasperated, entreating. At one point, she delivered a “whee!” and twirled around, her arms fully extended above her head. Mantello, who has directed her in two other Broadway plays, describes her as a “monster in the room. She supplies you with such a variety and wealth of choices, and she doesn’t need a lot of guidance.” The theater, the medium that is closest to Metcalf’s heart, is one of the few art forms left that you can’t see whenever you want to: You can’t watch a play on YouTube or stream it on Netflix. You had to be there, or you can only ever hear tell of it. It’s too late to see Metcalf’s Tony Award-winning performance in last year’s “A Doll’s House Part 2,” Lucas Hnath’s riotous sequel to the original Ibsen play, in which she hilariously and brashly manspread onstage like a cowboy in a corset. Despite 40 years of theater roles, she’s best known for having played the lovably blundering Aunt Jackie in the blue-collar ’90s sitcom “Roseanne,” a part that made her famous and, in the fashion of hit TV, familiar. But it is Metcalf’s role in Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird,” her first film in nearly a decade, that has lately encouraged us to see her anew. In her Oscar-nominated performance as Marion McPherson, mother of the teenage Lady Bird, she gives a performance so layered, vital and precise that it retroactively casts a spotlight on the meticulous but accessible, methodical but electric work she has been doing for decades. At 62, Metcalf is now being widely recognized for what she has always been, an actress of remarkable power, range and skill, a pre-eminent chronicler of the American working woman. Metcalf would be the first to say that her current tear — which includes three Emmy nominations in 2016 for “Getting On,” “Horace & Pete” and “The Big Bang Theory”; that Tony Award in 2017; the current Oscar nomination; “Three Tall Women”; and a new season of “Roseanne,” the first in two decades, arriving in March — all goes back to being given such meaty parts at an age when most actresses are being forced into retirement. But she knew exactly what to do with these parts when she got them. “She is so hard-working,” says Will Frears, who directed Metcalf in a 2015 Broadway adaptation of “Misery.” “She is extraordinary in her desire to be extraordinary.” Mantello told me that one thing he particularly loves about rehearsing with Metcalf are the moments when she’s engrossed in a scene and hears him laugh: “She sort of glances out at me and laughs with me. She’s both in it and aware she’s entertaining me at the same time.” I saw this double-consciousness in the rehearsal room, when B, A and C are reminiscing about losing their virginity, and A turns to B and asks if it hurt. Metcalf, kindly, but with a knowing tease in her voice, responded, “Oh ... well, a little.” Mantello guffawed. Metcalf locked eyes with him and cackled back. But as her laughter faded, her face settled into something much sadder, nearly tearful. It was impossible to tell when, exactly, she fell back into the character or if she had ever really broken away from her at all. The first play Metcalf ever appeared in was a high school production of “Auntie Mame.” She had only a few lines, but on the first night, she accidentally got a laugh on one of them. She immediately tried to parse what exactly had happened, so it could happen once more. “I think that’s what hooked me,” she says, “wanting to have that experience again onstage but be in control. It’s a cool, powerful feeling to direct the energy of the room.” But Metcalf was too practical and shy to imagine she would become an actor. Raised in Southern Illinois by her mother, a librarian, and her father, a budget director for the state university system, she went to college at Illinois State University and studied anthropology and German. She thought she would become an interpreter, which, as she likes to point out, she did. But she ended up doing a couple of shows in the theater department, impressing Terry Kinney, a fellow student who was pals with Jeff Perry and Gary Sinise. In 1976, Metcalf joined them and five other actors in a theater company housed in a church basement in Highland Park, outside Chicago. The group saved money by taking the name of a failed theater company that had already incorporated as Steppenwolf. Austin Pendleton, who became a member of the company in the ’80s, says working with Steppenwolf was “like opening a broom closet and finding the future of American acting.” Joan Allen, John Malkovich, Glenne Headly and Tracy Letts are just some of the company’s other members, nearly all of whom are recognizable from television, movies or theater. In the beginning, they all had day jobs. Metcalf was a legal secretary who could bang out 120 words a minute. When work was over, they would head to the basement theater and work some more, a commune, an incestuous sibling society (Metcalf dated Kinney first and then Malkovich, before marrying Perry, the father of her oldest child, the actress Zoe Perry). They picked their plays, cast them, directed when they drew the short straw, drank beer, ushered, took tickets, cleaned the bathroom and sold subscriptions. They cast themselves in parts no one else would have let them play. Metcalf was a septuagenarian in “True West” and a 14-year-old girl. She stole a show as the ugliest, flirtiest woman in the world, gave a monologue with yarn in her mouth and played Laura from “The Glass Menagerie” as profoundly mentally ill, a performance that drew critics from Chicago and that the people who saw it still speak of in reverent tones. Metcalf was in her late 20s when her oldest daughter was born. She left her at home with a sitter every night that she appeared in the 1983 Off Broadway staging of Lanford Wilson’s “Balm in Gilead,” a performance that has become the stuff of Broadway legend. A vast ensemble piece, set around a scruffy New York City diner, it was memorably punctuated by Metcalf’s 20-minute monologue as the inane, sweet prostitute Darlene, who prattles on and on until both she and the audience are in tears. After being cast in “Roseanne” — during just a two-week visit to California to audition for some movies — she moved to Los Angeles, where she still lives. She raised three children with her ex-husband Matt Roth, who played her abusive boyfriend on “Roseanne.” Her oldest son is now grown, and Metcalf lives with her teenage son and 12-year-old daughter. When she won the Tony Award for “A Doll’s House Part 2,” she thanked them for allowing her to be away so much. Metcalf has previously referred to herself as a workaholic, but when I asked her if this was true, she amended: “I can’t even call it work. I’m a creative-a-holic. I love the tearing into new material.” She recalls filming a three-person scene during the first season of “Roseanne,” in which she didn’t have much dialogue. During a break, the director came over and said to her, “You know, you don’t have to be acting during this part, because you’re not on camera.” Recalling this moment three decades later, she still can’t keep the outrage from her voice. “That’s the strangest thing I’ve ever heard! What would I do, just drop out? Just pull the plug and go dead for a while as they’re sitting two feet away from me?” There is a brawny, brainy populism to her high artistry, reflected in the everyday women she likes to play. Aunt Jackie is a hysterically funny working-class neurotic, lost and searching. In a 20-minute monologue in “Horace & Pete,” Metcalf uses only her face to tell a genuinely erotic tale of middle-aged desire. In HBO’s “Getting On,” which ended in 2015, her Jenna James, a geriatric doctor with the bedside manner of a rude telemarketer, is a cringe-comedy buffoon, whom Metcalf gives a soul. In “Lady Bird,” Metcalf plays Marion McPherson with enough verve and eye rolls to transcend the cliché of the nagging mother, suggesting with her performance that adolescent energy may not fade, so much as age into a more potent vintage. Her characters are high-strung women in the thick of busy lives, whose interiors Metcalf, from the midst of her own busy life, evokes with care, ingenuity and intensity. “I’m not trying to blow out a camera lens or make the audience’s hair go straight back from my sheer volume, sheer energy level,” Metcalf says, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t hold onto your hat. At the end of the first week of rehearsal for “Three Tall Women,” I met Metcalf in a Theater Row restaurant, the kind that has a mad dinner rush before the shows start at 8. She arrived in a puffy coat and a bright orange hat topped with a grand gray pompom, the same gray cowl neck sweater she wore during rehearsal, jeans and a pair of running shoes. Metcalf is extremely slight and unassuming, yet substantial. Perfectly engaging, she is not, like some actors, “on.” She has the slightly Midwestern air of a woman who is politely clocking everything but holding back her judgments until among friends. When the waiter asked us if we would like a five-ounce or eight-ounce pour of red wine, Metcalf emphatically selected the larger. Then she barely sipped it. She was both exhausted and full of ideas. “No matter how many times you’ve done it, the early stages of getting a show up on its feet is very hit and miss,” she said. “There seem to be thousands of options on every page to discover. All of a sudden, you find yourself like: I’m sitting in the same spot for about 10 pages, and I know that I would be bored looking at this. So now what do I do? I have to challenge myself to figure it out. Try it, try it, try it. Keep trying different things. It’s a big puzzle.” When I asked her when she last tried something that completely failed, she answered immediately: “Today, two hours ago.” Metcalf was still getting a handle on B. “I’m starting to see the possibilities of being a caretaker who cares and a caretaker who doesn’t care and that they can exist in the same person,” she explained. “When can I show when she doesn’t care?” She reached into her bag for the play, which was dog-eared and highlighted, and began to flip through it. “O.K.,” she said, “there’s a line in here where I say, ‘They want to take it off, her arm.’ The other character says, ‘What?’ It’s a clue, maybe, as to how my character could be super-perverse. If I wanted to go down that road, how do I play it with the wink so the audience knows that I’m trying to affect that other actor in a certain way?” And then Metcalf said the line in character, breaking into it as easily and instinctually as she might tuck the hair behind her ear. “The arm. They want to take the arm off.” Watching Metcalf do this, so effortlessly twist a line, made me think not so much about how acting is magic but how magic takes practice. The best tricks are built upon thousands of hours of training, rehearsal and preparation. In this way, acting is not unlike sports. Metcalf was described to me as an athlete more times than I can count, and watching her riff on that line was like watching someone hit a jump shot without even trying, on pure muscle memory, where the muscle Metcalf is flexing is her encyclopedic grasp of human behavior. Even Metcalf’s hobbies lend themselves to her work. She took her one sip of wine and launched into them. She does the crossword puzzle every morning and always has a jigsaw puzzle going at home. She knits, she crochets and, “in an obsessive craze,” she taught herself how to spin wool. “You have to learn it in your hands, and then once you do, you don’t have to think about it anymore,” she says. “It keeps my hands busy, which keeps my brain busy, and I can just sit and run lines or obsess about school lunches or whatever loop I find myself in.” One story I heard about Metcalf that stuck with me involved her performance in an Off Broadway production of Sam Shepard’s “A Lie of the Mind” in 2010. Metcalf asked Shepard why her character said so little when her husband would blather on and on. Shepard said something like, “Well, she’s not as smart as you, Laurie.” The next day, Metcalf took a pile of laundry with her onstage. When the actor who played her husband launched into one of his speeches, she started folding the clothes, eventually taking a pair of socks and stuffing them into her mouth. The audience burst into applause. Ethan Hawke, who directed the play and told me this story, said: “They completely understood everything she was thinking. And she elevated the play to a new level, because she knew that woman was as smart as her.” This is the quintessential Metcalf anecdote, an example of her expending her intelligence, work ethic and creativity to make deeper sense of this woman and the play, giving each a more comprehensive dignity. Sharr White, who wrote the 2011 play “The Other Place,” in which Metcalf starred as a scientist in a health crisis, described working with her as “the process of articulating through every moment and building it technically from the ground up, so it can start resonating emotionally. That’s what she does, builds it brick by brick by brick until it’s this solid, imposing performance.” She lays those bricks just so, until those bricks levitate. “You pour yourself into your work, you invest yourself 150 percent, and when you do,” Metcalf says, “you sleep well at night.” Willa Paskin is the television critic at Slate.

sports,"The Stone By Chris Lebron As a black philosopher, I am constantly navigating a path through the traditions and categories that define my profession. Most often, that navigation takes place between the canonical Western philosophy stretching back to Ancient Greece and the more recent intellectual output and contributions of previously excluded groups, including women, L.G.B.T people and African-American thinkers. This last tradition — the history of black thought — is a profound one for me; it is the foundation for my project of making sense of my place in America. But black thought’s role in our struggles for emancipation and the redemption of the American dream make it the inheritance of all Americans. Today, our nation is about as racially fraught as it ever has been. Our racially lopsided incarceration rates have led the scholar Michelle Alexander to dub our period the New Jim Crow. The persistence of police-perpetrated extrajudicial killings, such as the one that left Michael Brown’s dead body in the street for hours in Ferguson, Mo., has brought to mind for many observers horrific murders of black people in the past, such as the heartbreaking case of Emmett Till. Add to this a president who identifies white supremacists as “fine people,” and it becomes reasonable for us to wonder not only how black folks feel about these situations, but how they think about them. After all, it is our bodies that are on the line every day the sun rises on America. Black Americans’ continuous experiences with racial injustice prompt questions: What is racism, and why does it exist? How do we survive in America? And, since no one ought to live like this, what is to be done? That the black experience both motivates and unifies these questions is exactly the reason we can identify and study something called black thought. It is the intellectual tradition concerned with systematically and imaginatively studying and conveying the worst social, economic, and political treatment ever visited on a population, for nearly four centuries, and with no end in sight. One invigorating aspect of black thought — whether it is expressed in philosophy, literature, art, film, music or dance — is its clear and direct impact on society. Tied as it is to urgent questions of human dignity, freedom and justice, its manifestations and effects can ultimately be seen everywhere from the graffiti-graced brick walls of America’s inner cities to the halls of gilded centers of art and education. The most significant manifestation of this kind since the civil rights movement is Black Lives Matter. Widely credited to Patrisse Cullors, Opal Tometi and Alicia Garza in response to Trayvon Martin’s death on February 26, 2012, at the hands of George Zimmerman, and to Zimmerman’s subsequent acquittal. As America began to pay more attention to police shootings of unarmed blacks, the movement’s power grew. That power was derived from its simple, bold and irrefutably true proposition — that black lives do not exist for pleasurable disposal in a society still mired in its white supremacist history. Yet, despite the obvious truth of that statement, we may wonder: What are the moral and political arguments that underwrite the claim that black lives matter? While there is no way to articulate the full scope of those arguments in a single essay, it’s worth considering the philosophical contributions of some of the forerunners of the movement that is our most urgent manifestation of black thought today. The end of the Civil War and the subsequent ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 legally abolished slavery, but blacks quickly became subject to a displaced form of violence at the hands of white supremacists across the nation who typically used false accusations of sexual assault to justify lynching black men. Police turned a blind eye to these murders, and sometimes actively facilitated them. Ida B. Wells, a leading black thinker and journalist in the late-19th and early 20th centuries, and a co-founder of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, built a public career documenting lynchings and calling America to account for them. Her arguments extended and amplified those made by Frederick Douglass before her. Douglass’s central claim in his seminal “The Meaning of July Fourth for the Negro” was that Americans should feel shame for slavery, given their country’s foundational commitment to liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We were failing our own ideals. Wells pointed to the rise of lynching after the fall of slavery as not merely a legal matter to be rectified with new laws. Having fled her hometown to escape threats of her own lynching, Wells used the press to make her moral arguments. She described a nation in the grip of a dark remorse for freeing black Americans from slavery, and condemned white Americans for cruelties that violated their own commitment to the democratic project. The horrors that Wells described were a factor in the Great Migration of blacks to the North, which fed the flourishing of black thought and cultural life that gave rise to the Harlem Renaissance. An indication that the Harlem Renaissance was always meant to be a period of radical black philosophy and social change was the name originally coined for the movement: The New Negro. Alain Locke, the Harvard-educated black intellectual who became known as the father of the Harlem Renaissance, envisioned a philosophical position that reinvigorated blacks’ relationship to their culture and that would in turn solidify their status as equal co-participants in our democracy. A strong theme among some of the luminaries of the time focused on the will of blacks to assert their humanity against racism and to insist on their status as persons owed respect. Among those stars, the poet Langston Hughes was one of the brightest. His “I Too” is a quiet yet insistent poem depicting a black man employed by a white one and his struggle with invisibility. The protagonist resolves to sit at the table with the white folks the next day and show people how beautiful he is and that he, too, is America. The writer Zora Neale Hurston had an equally persistent but at times more playful take on the matter. In her essay “How It Feels to Be Colored Me,” she wrote, “Sometimes, I feel discriminated against, but it does not make me angry. It merely astonishes me. How can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company! It’s beyond me.” Thinkers like Hughes and Hurston were involved in the Harlem Renaissance project of presenting a vision of black cultural vitality and worth that would rework the image of black Americans that whites typically relied upon. That stream of thought runs directly into the heart of Black Lives Matter. Another valuable and necessary development to come out of the Black Lives Matter movement is the de-emphasizing of black patriarchy and the equal acknowledgment of the suffering of black women and the black L.G.T.B.Q. community. Though sexuality was an avenue of inquiry during the Harlem Renaissance, it was perhaps the mid- to late-20th century poet and theorist Audre Lorde who did the most to make black women’s sexuality a focal point of political and social philosophy. While today “intersectionality” is bandied about as the cutting edge of social research, it was Lorde who in her writing insisted on complicating our view of personal identity by claiming that each of us belongs to multiple identity communities, all of which contribute to our sense of self and our purposes. She also showed the broad reach of white supremacy and its effects on black Americans as they located themselves in more nuanced ways in the tapestry of American culture. For her, the primary form taken by resistance to racism was the denial of blunt categories imposed on black Americans, which stifled the possibility of an individual’s full flourishing. Lorde, then, called for a radical form of self-possession whose boundaries were not open to negotiation with a white society. When people think of Black Lives Matter, they often think of anger feeding forceful protests. Anger is a reasonable response to racial injustice. To be certain, groups like the Black Panthers and thinkers like Malcolm X advised black Americans to get angry and take the doctrine of armed self-defense seriously. Though anger and love are not mutually exclusive emotions, James Baldwin and Martin Luther King Jr. affirmed a view of civic love to pre-empt the need for violence. King espoused a form of Kantian regard that prioritized conceiving of every human, racist or not, as owed a kind of love that is grounded in the ideal of universal respect. Baldwin held a slightly different view. He felt black Americans ought to see whites as democratic kin or family, as people with whom blacks would have serious quarrels but also people whom it would be worth keeping close in order to strengthen and bring integrity to the bonds of shared democratic life. These two views of love eschewed violence yet insisted on militancy. While forgiveness and acceptance were hallmarks of King’s and Baldwin’s views, so was an unyielding commitment to self-respect and the demand for social change to institutionalize the idea that blacks were co-creators of the American kingdom. Thinkers like Wells, Hughes, Hurston, Lorde and Baldwin not only anticipated the current Black Lives Matter movement but provided an intellectual blueprint to give depth and integrity to that slogan, so that its meaning transcends the demand to stop police brutality. It is a demand for whites to extend their historical imagination and recognize that the ills of racism are not the result of a few bad police officers or a few out-and-out racists in some far-off corner of America. The problem, rather, is a kind of complicity — one partaking in the false comfort that America has somehow escaped the trajectory of its racially murderous history. It is necessary that we to see our society today as continuous with that history and not anomalous to it. Black thought’s primary contribution to the academy and to American society is the richness and precision with which it describes our worst demons to us, while offering a vision of how we might each save our democracy from the ruin of irrational fear and hatred. Chris Lebron is an associate professor of philosophy at Johns Hopkins University and the author of “The Making of Black Lives Matter: A Brief History of An Idea.” Now in print: “Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments,” and “The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments,” with essays from the series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books.

sports,"New York Today By Alexandra S. Levine Updated, 12:38p.m. Good morning on this fabulous Friday. “No Irish need apply.” That line, printed widely in classified ads from the mid-19th century, was meant to exclude Irish immigrants from work in the United States. Centuries later, a sign with those same words hangs in O’Neill’s Irish Bar in Hell’s Kitchen, at the behest of the bar’s owner, Ciaran Staunton, himself an Irish immigrant. “I’ve put that up because I want people to know that when we’re talking about the anti-immigrant movement here, that we ourselves were on the receiving end of ‘no immigrants need apply,’” said Mr. Staunton, who is from County Mayo in Ireland. “And worse than just signs.” When he’s not tending his bar on Ninth Avenue, Mr. Staunton, a founder of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, traverses the country helping the roughly 50,000 undocumented Irish immigrants in the United States — of which, he estimated, there are 15,000 in New York — forge a path to citizenship. For Irish immigrants, legalization remains the biggest hurdle, Mr. Staunton told us one day recently at O’Neill’s, as he concocted an Irish tea. “Especially in this era, in the anti-immigrant era of Trump, we need to stand up as Irish-Americans,” he said. “It is un-American to pull the ladder up after you; the American way is to pass it down to the next person, and silence is complicity when it comes to this.” Mr. Staunton moved alone from Ireland to Boston in 1982, at the age of 19. He found work at a bar but spent his free time lobbying for legal status for young Irish immigrants — himself included. (Few from his country had been admitted following the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which made strides for some immigrants but adversely affected others, including those from Ireland.) In 1987 Mr. Staunton helped form the grass-roots Irish Immigration Reform Movement, and by 1990, the group had helped push through the Morrison bill, which, through a lottery, granted legal status to most undocumented Irish immigrants in the country. Since gaining his American citizenship a decade later, Mr. Staunton has become a voice for same-sex marriage and sepsis education and prevention, after his son, Rory Staunton, died suddenly in 2012. (The Staunton family’s activism, in the wake of the tragedy, has led to medical reform nationwide and saved thousands of New Yorkers’ lives.) “I see no difference to my role, whether it’s representing bar owners at City Council hearings, addressing issues in Albany, or American money being involved in discrimination, or politics in Ireland,” he said. Stop by the bar to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day this weekend and, along with your drink, Mr. Staunton may offer an update on immigration reform or a quick history lesson — the bar is newly opened, but the relics on the wall transport patrons back to the 1700s. “Sometimes they want to talk history,” Mr. Staunton said, “and sometimes they just want one of our very good pints of Guinness.” Here’s what else is happening: B-e-a-utiful!

sports,"By Scott Cacciola PHILADELPHIA — When T. J. McConnell, a reserve guard for the Philadelphia 76ers, was married last summer, his brother and best friend surprised him at the end of the reception. The funky beat of a familiar song filled the room as the dance floor flooded with friends and family. McConnell knew the lyrics by heart: Here they come, Philadelphia, On the run, stand up and cheer! No. 1, Philadelphia, Here they come, team of the year! “Everyone went nuts,” McConnell said. The song was “Here Come the Sixers,” a disco-flavored anthem from 1975 that has become the soundtrack for the N.B.A.’s most precocious team. The 76ers are so young, they might as well take a school bus to their games. But they commemorate their victories by dancing to a song that practically struts down the street in bell-bottoms while shaking a tambourine. “It’s very strange,” said Terry Rocap, 70, a musician who performed on the original recording. “But it’s a good tune. People seem to like it.” The 76ers, under the direction of Scott O’Neil, their chief executive, have been dipping into the franchise’s past even as the team reinvents itself. Chris Heck, their president for business operations, cited the team’s new slate of uniforms, which quilt together several eras: There’s “Phila” lettering from 1960, stars from the 1970s and a collar taken from the jerseys worn by the 76ers during the 1982-83 season, when they last won an N.B.A. championship. “When Scott came in about five years ago, we got together and said, ‘We need to start bringing back what was great about the Sixers,’” Heck said. “Because the heritage is amazing.” That heritage also includes “Here Come the Sixers,” which O’Neil hoped to incorporate in recent seasons as a regular part of the game-night experience. But Heck said the rest of the staff voted to reserve it for home wins, which meant that nobody got to hear it much at all. (The Sixers were 10-72 just two seasons ago.) But success-starved fans of the team are optimistic. The 76ers employ several young players who are actually decent at basketball. And despite some recent growing pains, they should contend this season for their first playoff berth since 2012. Victories are hard-earned, though, and “Here Come the Sixers” is still something of a rare treat. “Scott’s always like, ‘I want to hear it more!’” Heck said. “And we’re like: ‘We love it, too. But we have to stay disciplined.’” The song urges fans to “clap your hands” and “stomp your feet” in support of “the team of the year,” which is, of course, the 76ers. For the musicians behind the song, its renaissance has been a pleasant surprise. “We figured the song would just be a fleeting moment of glory,” said Randy Childress, 68, who played bass guitar on the song. “But now it’s going to be on my epitaph.” At the time of the song’s creation, Childress was doing odd jobs for the 76ers while he finished his degree at Temple. He recalled that he once earned $500 for dressing up as a turkey at a game before Thanksgiving. A pair of female ushers, clad in pilgrim costumes, led him around. “I did all sorts of stupid stuff,” he said. As for the team itself, the 76ers were on the rise after years of yawn-inducing mediocrity. But Pat Williams, then the general manager, understood the 76ers needed to add some pep to the game-day experience if they were to draw larger crowds to the Spectrum, the team’s arena at the time. “We were trying to create the kind of atmosphere where it was a fun place to come,” he said in a telephone interview. So when Williams learned that Childress was in a rock band, he had an idea: Perhaps the 76ers needed their own theme song. Armed with a new assignment, Childress invited Rocap and a third bandmate named Joe Sherwood to his small apartment, where he had a four-track machine. They hammered out a demo, the original beat set by the steady dribble of a basketball. “Boink, boink, boink, boink,” Childress said. One morning, after watching “Sesame Street” with his 7-year-old daughter, Rocap arrived with lyrics: One, two, three-four-five, Sixers! Ten, nine, eight, 76ers! “And we’re going, ‘Oh, that’s great,’” Childress said. “So that’s where the initial burst came from, and then we built the whole song around it.” The band, known as Fresh Aire, wrote the song in E major, a key at the top of the vocal range for most male tenors. By pushing that range, Sherwood said, the song created energy. And in hopes of protecting its shelf life, over the years the band kept the lyrics free of references to specific players on the team — even the illustrious Julius Erving. On the track, the band harmonizes to an accompaniment that includes guitars, piano, bass and drums. Sherwood’s brother Richard gave the song some soul by jamming out on a Hohner Clavinet, a keyboard instrument at the height of cool in the 1970s thanks to Stevie Wonder. “My brother added a little riff,” said Joe Sherwood, 70, who began singing: “Here they come! Deedley deedley deeeee!” Williams, the Sixers’ general manager, appreciated how the song turned out — it was exactly what he wanted, he said — but the team kept its rollout subtle. “It really wasn’t a big deal,” Sherwood said. “There wasn’t any big hoopla or major announcement. They just started playing it.” World B. Free, 64, a former guard who now works as an ambassador for the team, was a first-year player when the song made its debut. Before home games, the song’s first few beats would reach the players as they took the floor. It became an even bigger deal once Erving, known as Dr. J, joined the team the next season. “We’d be coming out of the tunnel and the crowd would be getting juiced up,” Free said. “And then Doc would come out there with that big ol’ Afro and start throwing it down: Boom!” For better or for worse, the song has stuck with Free through the decades. “I hear it in my sleep,” he said. In the wake of “Here Come the Sixers,” other teams reached out to the band to write their theme songs, including one for the N.H.L.’s Washington Capitals called “Clap for the Caps.” But none of them had much staying power. And when Williams left the 76ers organization in 1986, the song more or less left with him. “But it had a good run,” Williams said. Childress, Rocap and Sherwood, meanwhile, spent several years touring and playing at clubs. Sherwood eventually started a recruiting business. Rocap became a professional window washer. Childress, who had studied architecture, began designing exhibits for trade shows and museums. The Sixers’ theme song was largely forgotten until the early 2000s, when it was resuscitated by Angelo Cataldi, a longtime host for Sports Radio 94WIP in Philadelphia. “We were really excited about the team, and we needed a song,” Cataldi said. “So we did some research and we found out there was really only one, and it was this ’70s disco thing, and it was dated and absurd. But that’s kind of our show.” Cataldi now regrets the part he played in keeping “Here Come the Sixers” alive — it’s not his favorite song, he said — but many others seem to have a more favorable opinion. Last season, Joel Embiid, the team’s effervescent center, celebrated a win against the Knicks by dancing to the song with several cheerleaders. Some of his teammates are similarly enchanted by it. “I actually play it all the time,” said McConnell, the 76ers guard. “My friends will be like, ‘Let me hear the song!’ And I’ll put it on.” When Williams, now senior vice president for the Orlando Magic, delivered the keynote address at a prayer breakfast in October, he was surprised by the entertainment: a rendition of “Here Come the Sixers” performed by Childress and Rocap. “I sat there listening, and I couldn’t believe what was happening,” Williams said. “These 700 people were carrying on like it was a Billy Graham crusade.” Williams said the reason for the song’s popularity was no secret. “Everybody likes to tap their toes and clap their hands,” Williams said. “Winning helps, too.”  Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
sports,"New York Today By Jonathan Wolfe and Alexandra S. Levine Updated, 10:23 a.m. Good morning on this bright Monday. After weeks of campaigning, millions spent and a few combative debates, New Yorkers will head to the polls tomorrow for a special election. Up for grabs are nine seats in the Assembly and two in the Senate — and with them, the opportunity for Democrats to control every branch of state government. It’s a record number of contests for a special election, and you can read more about the candidates and the most pertinent issues here. Six of the 11 races are in and around New York City. Of those, Assembly contests will take place: • On the Lower East Side (74th District), where the Democrat Harvey Epstein, a lawyer, will face the Republican candidate Bryan Cooper, an event planner. • In the Bronx (80th District) where the Democrat Nathalia Fernandez, the former chief of staff of the assemblyman vacating the seat, takes on the Republican Gene DeFrancis, a Navy veteran. • In Queens (39th District) where the Democrat Aridia Espinal is the only major party candidate on the ballot. • And in Nassau County (17th District) the Democrat Matthew Malin, who works for the Board of Elections, is being challenged by the Republican John Mikulin, a lawyer. And Senate contests will take place: • In the Bronx (32nd District), where the Democrat Luis Sepulveda, now an assemblyman, takes on Patrick Delices, a Republican and former professor at Hunter College. • And in Westchester (37th District), where the Democratic Assemblywoman Shelley B. Mayer faces Julie Killian, a Republican and a former deputy mayor of Rye. Extra special attention is being paid to these last two races, said Lisa Foderaro, who covers politics and government in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for The Times. [Ms. Foderaro explored the Westchester race in depth here.] For years, Democrats have held a majority in the Assembly and Senate, but their initiatives have been blocked by the Independent Democratic Conference, a group of eight Senate Democrats who voted with Republicans. But after seven years of infighting, the I.D.C. and the Democrats reconciled over cookies and coffee at a Manhattan steakhouse earlier this month. “Now that the breakaway Democrats have agreed to return and it looks like smooth sailing, the one final hiccup would be if one of these two seats — in the Bronx or in Westchester — were to go Republican,” Ms. Foderaro said. “If so, the Democrats’ dream of retaking the Senate would collapse because they simply wouldn’t have the numbers.” The polls are open tomorrow from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. You can look up your polling place here or call the Board of Elections at 866-VOTE-NYC.

sports,"On Soccer By Rory Smith HEERENVEEN, the Netherlands — Fans are melting away from all four sides of the Abe Lenstra Stadium as S.C. Heerenveen’s players amble around the edge of the field, taking in a cursory lap of honor after a hard-fought win against Sparta Rotterdam. Most of the squad is going through the motions: taking the shortest route possible, cutting the corners. They chat among themselves, occasionally lifting their heads to pick out friends and family in the crowd or to offer brief bursts of soft, mechanical applause. Only two players find themselves waylaid. One, Denzel Dumfries, has been voted man of the match. He scored the winning goal, and is now being held back by the need to balance the enormous bouquet of flowers he has received as his reward. The other, dallying behind the main group, has had a less productive evening. Martin Odegaard did not play badly; he had no shortage of energy, no drought of ideas. It was just one of those games where nothing quite worked. His touch was a little heavy, his passes just slightly off key. As he walks past the fans, though, there is a jolt of anticipation. A group of children summon him to the sideline. They stretch out their hands for him to touch, or proffer cellphones and scraps of paper for selfies and autographs. At this mid-table team, in this backwater town, Odegaard still carries with him an air of almost impossible glamour. Not long ago, after all, he was European soccer’s next big thing. He had made his debut for Stromsgodset, in his native Norway, at age 15, becoming the youngest player ever to feature in that country’s top division. A few months later, he was called in to the Norwegian national team, becoming the youngest player ever to represent his country. His rapid rise caught the magpie eyes of all of Europe’s grandest teams. Manchester United, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Liverpool all rolled out the red carpet for Odegaard, but in January 2015, Real Madrid snared him. He would be the jewel in the crown as the club set about buying up all of the best young talent available. He was registered for Real’s B team, at the time under the oversight of Zinedine Zidane, but trained most often alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and the rest of the club’s senior-team stars. In May of that year, Odegaard made his debut for Real’s senior team. It made him the youngest player to play for the European champions, too. That buzz has long since abated. All of the noise that surrounded Odegaard for a year has disappeared. Soccer, impatient, has moved on to other prodigies. As Odegaard — still just 19, still baby-faced — dutifully signs autographs and poses for pictures on a bitterly cold night in this city in the north of the Netherlands, it is impossible not to think that he is a long way from Real Madrid, a long way from where he was meant to be, and to wonder whether moving to the biggest team in the world was too much, too soon. “It is impossible to answer that question,” Tore Pedersen, a former Norwegian international defender, said when asked whether Odegaard could have found a more direct route to his goals by choosing another of his suitors. Pedersen, now an agent, consulted on Odegaard’s moves to both Madrid and Heerenveen. Of far more significance — to Odegaard and to those concerned with his career — is that he is, now, in the right place to nurture his talent. In two years at Real Madrid, he made only one start for the first team, in the Copa del Rey. Carlo Ancelotti, the club’s former manager, dismissed his signing as a “PR stunt.” Zidane, who coached him on the B team, would not go that far, but he also did not draft Odegaard into the senior team when he was named manager. In January last year, Odegaard decided he needed an “intermediate step,” the chance to play competitive games somewhere. A loan to Heerenveen was deemed the best option. “It was a good chance to play,” Pedersen said. “The culture is similar in Holland to Norway, so it easier to settle, and Heerenveen has a good record with Scandinavian players.” It would be a home away from home, the thinking ran, a more natural progression into the senior game. Morten Thorsby, one of several Norwegians on Heerenveen’s roster, contacted Odegaard to persuade him. The Netherlands, too, seemed to offer the right environment to allow him to flourish. “There is a little bit more space, a little bit more time,” said Stijn Schaars, Heerenveen’s captain, of the style of play in the top division, known as the Eredivisie. “It is good for young players to grow, to develop the game and the body, before moving on to other leagues.” That is not to say it was easy. Odegaard’s first day at the club brought more television cameras than Heerenveen’s manager, Jurgen Streppel, had ever seen. “It’s what you expect for a European Championship final,” he said. Despite the otherworldly vibe that Odegaard seemed to bring, though, he was still just a teenager, unaccustomed to the stresses and strains of elite soccer. By his own admission, he had “mixed feelings” about his first six months. He passed on a request to be interviewed for this article. Heerenveen kept its faith. Odegaard asked to be given the coveted No. 10 jersey last summer, and his wish was granted. Streppel promised him he was one of the four key players in his plans for this season, but asked that he try to be more decisive in games. “He has to be able to make a difference in Holland in game after game,” Streppel told the Norwegian newspaper VG. “Only that will be good enough if he is to succeed in a really top team.” This season has brought an improvement. Odegaard has scored just one Eredivisie goal in 15 league appearances, and created only one other, but nobody at Heerenveen plays more key passes per game. He is learning, too, to be more vocal. “He is not a guy with a big mouth,” Schaars said. “But he is a smart player. Smart players have more vision than normal players, so if you see something, say it.” That is why Odegaard is here: to mature, on the field and off it. He has passed his driving test — when he first arrived, the club issued him a bicycle to help him get around — and he now lives on his own, after his father, who had lived with him for six months, returned to Norway. He intends to go back to the Bernabéu as a man, rather than a boy. That has always been the aim: to win a place at Real Madrid. He has not forgotten why he is here, and his parent club has not forgotten him, either. Real Madrid is in regular contact with Odegaard, his father and Heerenveen, to monitor his progress. Video of his games is regularly sent back to Madrid, and every so often a scout comes to see him in the flesh. Against Sparta, an observer would not have seen a player who looks ready to displace Ronaldo, or Isco, or any of the other superstars on Real’s books. He may have to go out on loan again before he can make that leap; that decision, Pedersen said, will be made in the summer. But as he was swarmed by fans, they would have seen a boy who still shines, even after three years in the shadows. Follow Rory Smith on Twitter: @RorySmith.

sports,"Cavaliers 128, Raptors 93 By Benjamin Hoffman It would have been a career night for nearly any other player in the N.B.A., but for LeBron James, a line of 29 points, eight rebounds and 11 assists in the Cleveland Cavaliers’ series-clinching win against the Toronto Raptors on Monday hardly seemed noteworthy. That’s how outlandish expectations for James have gotten. These playoffs have offered plenty of highlights for James. He’s crossed the 40-point mark four times, recorded two triple-doubles, and hit two game-winning buzzer beaters. He broke Tim Duncan’s record for career postseason minutes played (in 28 fewer games than Duncan) and he so thoroughly humiliated the top-seeded Raptors on their home court that the term “LeBronto” was coined. He even managed to make high-arching fadeaway jumpers from the midrange look cool as he regularly used DeMar DeRozan’s signature shot to defeat him. But in Monday’s 128-93 win in Cleveland that gave the Cavaliers a sweep of the Eastern Conference semifinal series, James’s often-underwhelming supporting cast provided nearly as many first-half highlights as their unquestioned leader did. Kevin Love, never known for his defensive tenacity, was a force around the basket, J.R. Smith poured in 12 first-quarter points, and Kyle Korver did stellar work beyond the perimeter, going 3 for 3 from 3-point range. James scored just 2 points in the first quarter and 10 in the half. But even his most frequent detractor, the FS1 commentator Skip Bayless, seemed to understand that taking things easy for a little while and letting the other Cavaliers do the heavy lifting made sense. James was never going to take the whole game off. In the second half he reasserted himself as the center of the Cavaliers’ universe and slammed the door on the Raptors, extending his own record to 12 career sweeps in best-of-seven series. The latest quick dismissal earned James and his teammates a minimum of five days of rest before they play another game, which could stretch to seven depending on how the series between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers plays out. (Philadelphia picked itself off the mat in Game 4 on Monday, avoiding a sweep by Boston.) “We’re about to get some rest,” James said emphatically in an on-court interview broadcast on TNT. “I’m definitely about to get some rest.” Cleveland appeared to be running on fumes entering the series against the Raptors, having just finished a hard-fought, seven-game series against the Indiana Pacers. B ut instead of wilting they seemed to get stronger leading into what will be James’s eighth consecutive appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals. The question, of course, is whether any of James’s heroics will ultimately matter. In the conference finals he will be facing one of two youth-laden teams engineered to try to end his dominant run. The 76ers have “The Process,” and the Celtics were similarly built through free agency and the draft; whichever team survives will want to prove that their many can beat the Cavaliers’ few. Even if James can will his teammates beyond Boston or Philadelphia, he then would face long odds in the finals against the challenger from the Western Conference, most likely either the Golden State Warriors or the Houston Rockets, as both teams hold 3-1 series leads. For now, James will rest and wait to see how things play out. After he proved that Toronto’s deep lineup was no match for him, he will be eager to prove the same is true for the other teams that appear so much better on paper. At some point people may be reminded to stop doubting him, at least as far as Eastern Conference playoff games are concerned. And if things don’t work out in the playoffs, Enes Kanter has suggested he can join the Knicks.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
sports,"By Chris Stanford  (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Here’s what you need to know: • A week after student-led marches around the U.S. called for gun control, both sides in the debate think they are being underestimated. “It’ll go away,” a 77-year-old gun owner in Virginia said of the protests. “Like all the other times.” Forty miles away, a high school student had a different take: “They’re looking for us to get bored. We’re not going to get bored.” The young activists are hoping to drive real change in this fall’s midterm elections and beyond, but that would hinge on reversing years of below-average voter turnout for their age group. • In an essay for The Times Magazine, a lifelong gun owner wrestles with the changes to gun laws that he says must come, and with his fears of what such changes might destroy. • Twelve years ago, Charles Kushner was making wallets at a prison camp in Alabama. So it felt like redemption when the real estate baron’s son Jared was named President Trump’s senior adviser. But being at the pinnacle of American political power has turned out to be a wellspring of trouble for the Kushners. Their access to the president has brought criminal and regulatory inquiries, and their business empire’s deals are scrutinized for hints of federal influence. • In a recent interview, Charles Kushner had an invitation for investigators: “Go knock yourselves out for the next 10 years,” he said. “We didn’t do anything wrong.” • Officials across the U.S. are struggling to control the use of e-cigarettes among students. The devices are so easily concealed that it’s possible to vape in class. • E-cigarettes are widely considered safer than traditional ones, but health officials fear that vaping is creating a new generation of nicotine addicts. • The Morning Briefing doesn’t mention Uzbekistan very often, but the Central Asian nation has recently been a source of (relatively) good news, bucking a global trend toward authoritarian rule. Eighteen months after the death of its longtime dictator, Uzbekistan’s new leadership has been trying to open up one of the world’s most repressive countries by releasing political prisoners and allowing some freedom of expression. • “The ice is melting in this country,” a confidant of the new president told our correspondent. • China announced tariffs as high as 25 percent on 128 American-made products today. The move is intended to pressure the Trump administration into backing down from a simmering trade war. • Anchors at local TV news stations across the U.S. made identical comments last month about media bias. The script came from the stations’ owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group. • In the tight U.S. labor market, positions in out-of-the-way places like poultry plants and lumber mills can be tough to fill. But that presents an opportunity for refugees. • Speaking of jobs, the March employment report is among the headlines to watch this week. • U.S. stocks were closed on Good Friday. Here’s a snapshot of global markets today.

The annual White House Easter Egg Roll is scheduled to take place today on the South Lawn. The tradition dates from 1878, when Rutherford B. Hayes was president, though some accounts suggest that informal egg-rolling parties began under Abraham Lincoln. The first lady, Melania Trump, will host guests who won a public lottery in February. In the signature event, children guide the eggs across the lawn with a wooden spoon. There will be live music and other activities, including a reading nook staffed by White House figures like Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary. New this year: bowling. The elaborate and labor-intensive Egg Roll is among the most daunting social events a presidential staff has to plan, The Times noted last year. Guests receive souvenir wooden eggs as they leave, a tradition that began when Nancy Reagan was first lady. This year, the commemorative eggs were made from birch by a company in Maine, and they’re also available online. The White House says that more than 21,000 guests attended last year. That was down from about 37,000 in recent years. They expect 30,000 today. Karen Zraick contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekdays and updated all morning.

sports,"The Carpetbagger By Cara Buckley It was Oscar nominations day in Los Angeles, and Steven Spielberg was so certain his picture would do gangbusters that he invited over a camera crew to film his reaction as the nominees were read out live on television. Things didn’t quite go as planned. Mr. Spielberg’s movie was nominated for best picture, but his name was not among the directing nominees, prompting two friends watching with him to splutter in outrage. “This is a dark day in Hollywood,” one friend told the camera. “The greatest picture of all time was made and they haven’t recognized the director.” The camera swung over to friend No. 2. “Who made it?” he asked, referring to the film. “The shark?” The movie was “Jaws,” the year, 1976, and if Mr. Spielberg, fresh-faced and 29, was stunned by the rebuff, he played it off as a joke. “I’m suffering,” he said. “Cancel my day. Cancel my week. I’m going to Palm Springs.” Wryness aside, the pointed cold-shouldering from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was something Mr. Spielberg would be forced to reckon with, or at least stomach, right up until today. With 17 Oscar nominations — seven of them for directing — and three wins (four, counting the honorary Oscar he received in 1987), Mr. Spielberg has hardly been ignored by the academy. But, along with “Jaws,” his films “The Color Purple” (which landed 11 Oscar nominations), “War Horse,” “Bridge of Spies” and now “The Post” all secured Academy Award nominations for best picture but not for their director. Explanations for the latest snub abound. Some film experts see in it echoes of the fraught relationship, curdled by jealousy, that first sprang up between the academy and Mr. Spielberg around the time of “Jaws.” “Coldhearted academy members can think, ‘Here’s the one thing we can deny the man who has everything,’” said Tom O’Neil, founder of the awards forecasting site Gold Derby. “He’s penalized for being good. They have to punch a hole in him somehow.” Others say that “The Post” feels too much like a traditional Oscar movie from another time, a hallmark of an establishment that, funnily enough, resisted accepting Mr. Spielberg in the first place. “Is it the long-term enmity showing itself again? He’s not a kid. He’s a gray eminence by now,” said Lester D. Friedman, emeritus professor of cinema at Hobart and William Smith Colleges and the author of “Citizen Spielberg,” which examines the filmmaker’s career. “I just think it hit the wrong note in the wrong historical period.” Others dispute that it’s a snub at all. When the academy expanded its best picture pool to up to 10 nominees in 2009, it kept the best director category limited to five. The exclusion of a few directors is inevitable every year, including this one, when there were nine best picture nominees. “Had there been nine directors nominated, there’s not a chance in my mind that he wouldn’t have been there,” said Sid Ganis, a producer and a past president of the academy. “What some call snubs and others call craters sometimes just happen that way.” While “The Post” arrived late in the season, it had all of the outward marks of a runaway awards winner. It starred Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks as Katharine Graham and Ben Bradlee, and told a larger story — of a paranoid president, Richard M. Nixon, who fought the press and tried to keep state secrets from the public — that had clear resonance today. Critics met the film warmly, and Seth Meyers made a gag of its starry might during his opening monologue at the Golden Globes in January, introducing it as a woman came onstage with an armful of trophies. “No, not yet, we have to wait,” Mr. Meyers said, to guffaws. But “The Post,” which was up for six Globes, went home empty-handed, and, weeks later, scooped up just two Oscar nominations (the second went to Ms. Streep). In some views, its failure to gain much awards traction is an indicator of a shifting Oscars landscape, where “Moonlight,” a small independent film with an all-black cast, won best picture over the white-on-white spectacle of “La La Land.” Mr. Friedman said in this awards season especially, one distinguished by underdog stories and diversity in “Lady Bird,” “Get Out” and other pictures, “The Post” felt out of place. For all of its important messaging, it remains a very white, very upper-middle-class film. “This isn’t the year for a middle-of-the-road Hollywood drama,” he said. Still, others watching the Oscar game feel that Mr. Spielberg remains a man whose talents are taken for granted by many academy members, and whose current work invariably competes with the high bar he set for himself with “Schindler’s List” (1993), his multiple-Oscar-winning drama. Joseph McBride, a film professor at San Francisco State University and the author of “Steven Spielberg: A Biography,” said that while he considered “The Post” a flawed, run-of-the-mill film that told “a liberal fairy tale about how we have a free press,” it still showed that as a director, Mr. Spielberg was “a master of his craft.” “He has been around so long and has been so honored (since some but not all of the hatred of him has lessened in Hollywood and elsewhere) that he may be seen as somewhat old-hat and his skills assumed rather than honored,” Mr. McBride wrote in a follow-up email. Early aversion to Mr. Spielberg was rooted in the filmmaker’s box office successes, something Mr. Spielberg spoke to in the “Jaws” snub clip. “This is called commercial backlash,” his young self said to the camera. “When a film makes a lot of money, people resent it. Everybody loves a winner. But nobody loves a winner,” he added a little later, emphasizing the last word. For a while, Mr. Friedman said, Mr. Spielberg was seen as “a lightweight, a great B director of action films,” churning out one hit after another. In his book, Mr. McBride quoted the film critic Pauline Kael, who counted among the many observers who blamed Mr. Spielberg for Hollywood’s so-called blockbuster syndrome, and groused, “Everyone else has imitated his fantasies, and the result is the infantilization of culture.” “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” all landed best director nods, but couldn’t land Mr. Spielberg the win. “Jealousy has haunted Spielberg throughout his career,” Mr. O’Neil said. “And he’s paid his price at the Oscars too many times.” When Mr. Spielberg switched to more serious fare, like “The Color Purple” (1985), he drew critical opprobrium that endures — a 2014 Los Angeles Magazine article lamented its “Disneyfication of race in America.” “Empire of the Sun,” released two years after “Purple,” has since won more critics over. Still, at the time, Mr. Spielberg was often seen as a showman who had no place tackling big subjects and, Mr. Friedman said, became “the New York Yankees of film production.” “They hated him as everyone hated the Yankees, or the New England Patriots,” Mr. Friedman said. “He had the biggest budgets, the biggest stars, the biggest profits.” With “Schindler’s List,” Mr. Spielberg finally won his first directing Oscar. “They could not deny it to him,” Mr. O’Neil said. He also collected best director five years later for “Saving Private Ryan.” And in adding “Lincoln” and “The Post” to his oeuvre, Mr. Friedman said, “he seems to have evolved into our national history teacher” (quibbles about the films’ historical accuracy aside). For what it’s worth, not everyone, at least publicly, agrees that there’s lingering jealousy. Mr. Ganis said Mr. Spielberg was considered “one of the best, and iconic in his ways.” The fact that he made “The Post” while finishing another movie — “Ready Player One” — Mr. Ganis said, made fellow filmmakers “scratch our heads, and wonder how he does what he does, and how it comes out so good.” For his part, Mr. Spielberg, who is in postproduction with “Ready Player One,” wouldn’t offer an explanation for his latest no-show on the directors list. “It’s not for me to say because I respect my fellow directors, producers and their academy branches,” he wrote via email.
