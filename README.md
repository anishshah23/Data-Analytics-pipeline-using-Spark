# Data-Analytics-pipeline-using-Spark
Processing graph data using Spark 
Applying my data analytics knowledge (word frequency, word-co-occurrence) and machine learning skills to perform multi-class classification of text data using Apache Spark.
Built a data pipeline using
a. Data from sources such as NY Times articles using the APIs provided by the data sources.
b. Split the data into training and test data set.
c. Extracted features that will determine the class or category of the article {politics, sports,
   business, etc}
d. Built a model for classification using classification algorithms such as Logistic regression, Naive Bayes ,and Random Forest.
e. Compare the classification accuracy of at least two well-known classification algorithms,
   for a given text data set.
