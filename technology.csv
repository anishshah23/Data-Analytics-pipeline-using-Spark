technology,"Op-Ed Contributor By Scott Malcomson Mr. Malcomson is the author of “Splinternet: How Geopolitics and Commerce Are Fragmenting the World Wide Web.” Is Silicon Valley going to war? In 2013, Amazon beat IBM for a contract to host the United States intelligence community’s data cloud. Microsoft now markets Azure Government Secret, its cloud-computing service designed specifically for federal and local governments, to the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. And last year, Google signed a contract with the Pentagon for Project Maven, a pilot program to accelerate the military’s use of artificial intelligence. These partnerships might ease anxiety in the Defense Department about China’s artificial-intelligence advances and ominous, state-led fusion of civil and military technology development. But a comparable fusion of the United States government and Silicon Valley would be a mistake. This is not so much because it would compromise Silicon Valley values, as more than 3,000 Google employees argued in a recent letter about Project Maven to the company’s chief executive, Sundar Pichai. Rather, it’s because the United States’ edge in techno-military competition exists in great part because we have a tech sector that is not dominated by the state and its needs. Narrowing the focus of the United States tech sector to the needs of the military would serve neither party. On the contrary, it would make the nation weaker. To be sure, defense contracts are hardly new in Silicon Valley, and Google’s recent moves might be seen as heralding Silicon Valley’s return to its natural home in defense contracting. But that would be to misunderstand both Silicon Valley history and today’s technology. The internet and much of digital computing did indeed emerge from decades of United States defense contracts, beginning as long ago as World War I. Yet the Pentagon itself sloughed off the internet — not knowing quite what to do with it, and rightly judging it to be insecure — to the National Science Foundation. When the internet became a commercial concern, the National Science Foundation off-loaded it to the Department of Commerce. Government might have given birth to the internet, but it sure didn’t raise it. The emergence of a civilian, entrepreneurial tech culture in the 1970s owed as much intellectually, if not (at first) financially, to the antiwar movement and the 1960s counterculture — hardly friends of the military-industrial complex. Out of this the dominant, highly creative ethos of geek antiauthoritarianism grew. It is hard to believe that closer ties with the military would perpetuate this culture of innovation. The technology involved in projects like Azure Government Secret and Project Maven is also very different from the data-sharing projects of the 1960s. Those older technologies would not have been created in the absence of government funding. Today’s projects, in contrast, are all basically A.I. plays. Very little of this is defense-specific, but all of it is useful for defense and espionage. Unlike, say, weapons development, A.I. research is inherently dual-use. United States tech giants would be pursuing it with or without government contracts. Silicon Valley does not need the Pentagon to initiate these endeavors. The Pentagon is in a different position. It came around very reluctantly to the idea that it is dependent on private industry for the defense of the country and the projection of American power. But come around it has, in no small part thanks to China. China’s state interest in A.I. was initially economic, but military uses were never far behind. As Elsa B. Kania, a researcher at the Center for a New American Security, explained in an influential report, “A.I. is a high-level priority within China’s national agenda for military-civil fusion,” a strategy that should allow the Chinese armed forces to benefit from private-sector advances in A.I. The United States military seems to have been spooked. In a 2017 memo, the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, wrote that while the Defense Department had made “tentative steps” in A.I., “we need to do much more, and move much faster.” The memo announced the formation of Project Maven to do just that. This month, Gen. Stephen Wilson, the vice chief of staff for the Air Force, said that China is taking a “whole of nation” approach to A.I. and the United States should, too. Yet we shouldn’t forget that civil-military antagonism and the deep American tradition of distrusting the state have been crucial to the United States’ ability to innovate. There are good reasons why defense-tech giants of the 1960s, ’70s and ’80s like Raytheon and Grumman missed out on such major tech advances as Web protocols, the smartphone, personal computers and various types of encryption — all of which would eventually have great military significance. The biggest reason was that none of these advances were directed at waging war; indeed, many aimed at transcending the power of the state. After the Cold War, the Soviet Union’s extraordinary technological capacity dissipated in large part because it had been so reactive: The Soviets had let their adversary determine the pace and scope of their own innovation. The United States should not make that mistake.

BEHEMOTH A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World By Joshua B. Freeman Illustrated. 427 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $27.95. Joshua B. Freeman doesn’t chronicle the aftershocks of the loss of five million factory jobs from the American landscape or show you the impact of disappearing factory jobs on towns across America. And I wish he had addressed the abandoned plants, escalating drug crime and crowded food pantries. But what this distinguished professor of history at CUNY’s Queens College does is lay out two centuries of factory production all over the world in ways that are accessible, cogent, occasionally riveting and thoroughly new. The history of large factories, as Freeman outlines it, is the history of the modern world and most everything we see, experience and touch. At a time when the ghost of the American dream hovers over headlines ranging from free trade vs. protectionism to opioid addiction and other so-called diseases of despair, “Behemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World” should be required reading for all Americans, especially the 8 percent of the American labor force who still work in manufacturing (down from 24 percent in 1960). If you are reading this review on an iPad or iPhone or another Silicon Valley-designed computer screen, then Freeman’s history will not only explain how and where your device came to be produced but also how the story of modern production parallels the story of your relative level of affluence, from the balance in your retirement funds to the circumstances prompting your ancestors’ migration from an unproductive Irish potato field to a western Pennsylvania steel mill. There are few items in our homes that didn’t originate as disparate components in faraway supply plants, touched by many hands in multiple countries. But whose hands actually make and order the assembling of the products, from the B-24 builders in Ypsilanti, Mich., whose goods flew into combat during World War II, to the corporate owners who erected three million square meters of yellow netting to prevent overworked Chinese Foxconn workers from jumping to their deaths in 2010? Freeman tells us who both the makers and the corporate owners are, and, more impressively, he shows us how, over a relatively short period of time, their stories come to be entangled. He wants us to leave his book grappling with the question: How should human beings balance economic good with environmental harm, need with greed? He is more concerned with the building up of factories than the tearing down, chronicling the pros and cons of factory work with a scholar’s even gaze. When a developing country embraces manufacturing to propel itself away from agrarian subsistence, the work is invariably rote and exploitive and often even life-threatening. But, over all, life expectancy climbs and poverty and disease plummet. That was as true in the wake of the Industrial Revolution in Western Europe — before which only half of French children, plagued by hunger and disease, lived to see the age of 20 — as it is now in Ethiopia, where the producers of Ivanka Trump’s shoes recently relocated from Dongguan, China, chasing a more desperate work force content to work for a pittance (roughly $30 a month) rather than paying the rising wages of their predecessors in China ($560). Capitalism, naturally, takes advantage of such increasingly swift and secretive moves. It was the striving capitalists, after all, who pioneered the world’s initial giant factories — first among them a British wigmaker named Richard Arkwright who patented his spinning machine in 1768, then created an empire of steam-powered cotton mills. Arkwright knew he had arrived when he was able to lend the Duchess of Devonshire 5,000 pounds to pay down her gambling debts, even if he and his fellow mill owners used laborers as young as 7 years old. Freeman dips into a delicious expanse of source material from Charles Dickens to Karl Marx to Tim Cook, from Bloomberg Businessweek to The National Rip-Saw. In roughly chronological order, British silk mill owners give way to the Boston barons who developed the factory town of Lowell, Mass., in 1822, building dorm-style housing for the out-of-town farmers’ daughters they hired and innovating a standardized production process that bested the British and would “morally uplift” via such utopian amenities as company-sponsored libraries and potted plants. The wealthy Boston merchant Francis Cabot Lowell not only figured out how to churn out white sheeting more efficiently — the fabric used to make slaves’ clothing — but he was also the brains behind the radical innovation of the stockholder corporation. Before Lowell, that model was rare, usually reserved for public works, not the accumulation of private wealth. Freeman loops around the globe nimbly, drawing parallels between the farmers’ daughters who sent money home from Lowell and the Chinese migrants who do the same from Guangdong almost two centuries later. Though I wish he would have lingered longer on the workers’ lives, he has a sharp eye for the raw, gut-kicking detail. A riveter in the Urals freezes to death on a scaffolding. Middle managers in Michigan have to learn the words for “hurry up” in English, German, Polish and Italian to keep Henry Ford’s assembly line humming along. As he does with Diego Rivera’s industry-worshiping murals in Detroit, Freeman’s mini-portrait of the photographer Margaret Bourke-White shows how the public came to view manufacturing through her factory-fanatic lens, from Ford’s River Rouge plant in Dearborn, Mich., to Stalin’s giant tractor factory in a former melon field. With Henry Ford’s top architect, Albert Kahn, as their consultant, the Soviets squeezed wealth out of the countryside on the road to creating a socialist society after an initial epic fail. “The Russians have no more idea how to use the conveyor than a group of schoolchildren,” Freeman quotes Bourke-White saying. “One Russian is screwing in a tiny bolt and 20 other Russians are standing around him watching, talking it over, smoking cigarettes, arguing.” But the Russians eventually figured out how to make manufacturing advance both their socialist culture and their economy, inspiring the East Europeans, all of whom later inspire Taiwanese and Hong Kong businessmen setting up Chinese government-backed shops in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Freeman’s final chapter, “Foxconn City,” is the finest and most searing profile of wealth-makers in the bunch, revealing the sheer drudgery of overworked people who make sneakers and iPhones but can’t afford to buy them and the quiet deal-making machinations fueling Silicon Valley’s billionaire class. Quoting the Apple executive Tim Cook, the mastermind behind offshoring production to Taiwanese-owned contractors in China before his ascent to chief executive, Freeman shows how just-in-time production flourishes on the backs of poorly paid workers who are shifted from one factory to another in an entirely different region practically at the stroke of his keyboard. When it comes to inventory, Cook said, “you kind of want to manage it like you’re in the dairy business. If it gets past its freshness date, you have a problem.” When wages rise because of retention problems or labor unrest, the Chinese government is happy to help Apple and others by handing out tax breaks and transportation projects to spur new, lower-paying factories in China’s hinterlands. No such help is on tap for a worker, trained with a specialized skill, stuck in a country that no longer supports the industry she works in and living in places like Flint, Mich., which can’t even guarantee the water is safe. For the displaced, Freeman writes, “the future has already come and gone, perhaps leaving them with sneakers and a smartphone, but with little hope” for forging a post-factory life that is both sustainable and ecologically sound. Though he never states it outright, Freeman’s inclusion of poetry by a Foxconn worker who committed suicide in 2014 telegraphs where his allegiances lie: They’ve trained me to become docile Don’t know how to shout or rebel How to complain or denounce Only how to silently suffer exhaustion. “Behemoth” is contextually thin in places, especially Freeman’s take on deindustrialization. He doesn’t mention that, as life expectancy in East Asia climbed, mortality rates rose in America, or that drug dealers, not farm girls seeking sewing jobs, now flock to Lowell — a distribution hub for heroin. Freeman only cursorily explores the aftermath of globalization, automation and unfettered free trade, and he doesn’t ask what the government owes the people still living in America’s former mill and mining towns. More robust retraining and access to need-based college financial aid? Incentives to resettle elsewhere? A New Deal for the displaced and drug-addicted? Perhaps it’s beyond the purview of a historian to wrestle with such questions. Perhaps it is enough that this thoroughly researched history makes us question our own accumulation of the stuff in front of us and our complicity in the truth we dare not see.

technology,"A blessed night on the town with Jeremy Scott. By Caity Weaver Clothed in a 30-pound pearl-encrusted dress the color of cream made of gold, a faintly lustrous silk duchesse satin overskirt that billowed like summer cumulus, gem-covered gloves that stretched to the shoulder, a jeweled halo headpiece, a thick buckle-and-pearl choker and colossal pearl drop earrings that clamped firmly to her ears on the backs of grinning gleaming putti, Cardi B communed with God in her hotel suite for 40 seconds. Technically, the faintly lustrous silk duchesse satin overskirt was still being affixed to her at the instant of communion by a knelt helper fastening a semicircle of hooks and eyes around her waist. But time was running out (technically, time had run out 30 minutes earlier). And so, even though the Bronx-born rapper and self-identified Catholic might have preferred to be untweaked and unjostled during her moment of devotion, allowances had to be made. The prayer of thanksgiving was led by her publicist, Patientce Foster. “Thank you for Jeremy Scott,” said Ms. Foster, her voice rushing out with the calm efficiency of a cool brook. Mr. Scott, Cardi’s date for the Met Gala last night, and, as the creative director of Moschino, the man responsible for her tulle and wool and buckles and gems, was standing behind Cardi, reverently running the tips of his fingers across the satin overskirt as she shut her eyes in silent prayer.  “We appreciate our friendship with Moschino,” said Ms. Foster, to God. “We ask that this night be successful, Lord. That you grace her feet, that you grace her presence, Lord. That she walks the carpet with everything that she has, Lord. That she gives everything that she has. We ask all these blessings in your name. Amen.” “Amen,” said Cardi B, designing an invisible cross in the air above her slightly sparkling face. “Okurrr!” added a few members of Cardi’s team, filling the room in the Carlyle Hotel with the sounds of an avian chorus. (“Okurrr,” with a trilled r, is one of Cardi’s signature exclamations. The association of Cardi with “okurrr” has become so strong that the hotel embroidered the interjection on one of her room’s pillowcases.) One year ago, Cardi’s sensational single “Bodak Yellow” had not yet been released, and she had to watch her more famous boyfriend (now fiancé) Offset, of the rap group Migos, dress for an ultraexclusive event to which she had never been invited. This year, on the 70th anniversary of the gala, she is, in the words of Mr. Scott, “obviously the girl that everyone’s after. She’s that new appointed pop princess. Diva, soon to be queen.” That Cardi’s first Met Gala should fall on a night honoring the Costume Institute’s exhibition “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” was serendipitous, given her tremendous affection for God. Her brief to Mr. Scott was that her gown be “very religious” and “very luxurious.” She was pleased that the final result reminded her of papal finery. “Popes wear big things with rubies and gems,” she explained, perhaps picturing less of a Pope Francis than one of those Medici popes, like the profligate Leo X, whose endorsement of the sale of indulgences led Martin Luther to instigate the Protestant Reformation. Mr. Scott, who frequently dresses Cardi in bold retro rainbow colors for performances, said her outfit was “very inspired by Vatican tapestries — the whole, kind of, embroidery of deities.” The dramatic coronal headpiece was meant to evoke the Virgin Mary. “You know,” said Mr. Scott, “like Mary, she is pregnant. But she know who the baby daddy is.” The dazzling companion suit to Cardi’s outfit, sported by Mr. Scott at the Gala, was originally intended to be worn by Offset. Then, after work had begun on the custom wool and pearl motorcycle jacket/tuxedo coat hybrid (with matching trousers), it was decided that all three members of Migos would, in fact, attend the party as guests of Versace, whose chief designer Donatella Versace was one of the Met Gala’s co-chairs. Fortunately, the trim Mr. Scott is roughly the same size as Offset. Like the priceless vestments passed down through centuries currently on display in the exhibit, the ensemble was handed down to him. Although Cardi seemed happy to attend the party as Mr. Scott’s date, dismay at the Versace intervention lingered. An hour or so before her official gala entrance, a blend of deep red lipsticks was painstakingly applied to her frown while she sat, robed, in a chair, and worried over Offset’s replacement outfit. “It’s like, if y’all got so much people going with y’all, y’all could have just let him walk with me and take the two boys,” she said, referencing Versace’s extra-long list of guests (which included Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian West and Tom Brady) and the other two members of Migos: Takeoff and Quavo. The circumstances, she said, had left her “upset.” “That’s why my baby ain’t never gonna stand out,” she said quietly. “What do you mean?” asked Ms. Foster, who was floating around the room checking on every single element of everything, while simultaneously coordinating Cardi’s schedule for the next day, and occasionally breaking into song. “Like, stand out on his own?” “Not even on his own,” said Cardi. “It’s just like, I know how he wants to be.” (All three members of Migos eventually appeared on the Met’s steps in matching color-coordinated Atelier Versace tuxedos.) One baby that would stand out at the Met Gala was the fetus currently gestating inside Cardi. Mr. Scott said he designed her dress to “gloss over her, which is what I thought would be best for her figure.” The snug fit and high belt emphasized her round stomach, even if the individual hand beading proved a little cumbersome for an expectant woman. “Extremely heavy,” is how Cardi characterized her outfit. “The beading is just crazy, and then,” she said, cradling her midsection, “shorty weighs three and a half pounds.” This news was met with laughs of delight from those assembled. “She do,” said Cardi. “She do weigh three and a half pounds. That’s pretty good for seven months, right?” she asked, looking around. “Because I was born five pounds.” The atmosphere inside the hotel suite cycled quickly between rapture and rupture. Ms. Foster and Cardi’s warm, lanky stylist, Kollin Carter, led goofy champagne toasts (in which the pregnant rapper did not partake). Cardi excitedly recounted past Met Gala themes, recalling their chronology better than anyone in the room. But her mood plummeted when she was alerted to the fact that a fan-run Instagram account had posted a video of a recent confrontation involving herself, a member of her security team and a fan in Las Vegas. She expressed her frustration with a torrent of harsh words, many of them criticizing the security guard who, she argued, had inflamed the situation. She watched the video multiple times on her phone, becoming increasingly irritated with every replay. She asked Ms. Foster to contact the fan account and request its owner remove the video. The bustling room fell silent, save for the furious clicks of Cardi’s nails against iPhone glass, as, amid this social media Sturm und Drang, Mr. Scott’s towering headpiece was gently positioned atop her head. There was nervous speculation about the best way to fasten it in place using the provided set of combs and ribbon ties. People half-joked about being afraid to hold the fragile object. It was a jeweled retaining wall barely holding back cascading black waves of hair. “I feel like that’s perfect,” said Ms. Foster, after a series of minute adjustments. Immediately, the crown fell. For a moment, Cardi said nothing. She could say nothing, for the incredibly delicate and expensive headpiece was smushed up against her carefully painted lips. As it was lifted, she declared to the room with cold, quiet fury, “This is why I said matte lipstick. ’Cause it smudge.” She was correct: Her lipstick had smudged. None of the beadwork had broken, but a few perfectly white pearls had been stained pink. Ms. Foster began individually swabbing them clean with Q-Tips. A judiciously placed FaceTime call from Cardi’s younger sister, Hennessy, lifted her mood tremendously. “Slay!” Hennessy screamed through the speaker as she admired Cardi’s gown. “Slay!” The effect was of air whipped into a meringue. “I wanna cry!” exclaimed Cardi giddily a few moments later, as holes were snipped in her jeweled gloves so that her jeweled nails could poke through. A handshake with her at this point felt like a handshake with a very expensive lizard. She turned to Ms. Foster. “You don’t wanna cry?” “I wanna drink,” said Ms. Foster. She poured herself a glass of champagne. (Celebratory.) Cardi’s voluminous skirt took up most of the cramped hotel elevator. It took up most of wherever she was, in fact. After wading through a crowd of screaming onlookers gathered outside the hotel to see a celebrity, any celebrity, she was forced to stand in the extra-large van hired to transport her the few blocks from the hotel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. When a member of the Moschino team asked “How you doin’, Mama?” Cardi responded “Ah?” She was unable to turn her body around, or swivel her head to see past her mass of hair, to determine the source of the question. “Who’s talking to me right now?” she asked with a laugh. Cardi practiced her pose, which was: hands at sides. As the automobile crawled slowly forward, she was able, by a series of very meticulous adjustments, to position herself so that she was kneeling on the first row of back seats, facing out the rear window. Through careful manipulation of her embellished gloves and dagger sharp acrylic nails bearing more jewels than the earth’s crust, she entered her iPhone’s passcode. She began refreshing the hashtag #CardiB on Instagram, anxious to see how her dress had looked on the seconds-long walk from the hotel to the van, and to glean people’s reactions to it.  “You don’t want —” she began, and cut herself off, scrolling nervously through search results. (As well as countless posts recycling the same few images from her short stroll, the hashtag also revealed occasional spam of nude strangers.) “The first picture goes viral. Always. And you don’t want the first picture to be terrible.” Mercifully, Cardi had only a few minutes to stress about the quality of the first frantic photos of herself and Mr. Scott. Less than half a mile later, it was time for her real trial: Getting her dress out of the van. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
technology,"Books of The Times By Jennifer Szalai The current president may be completely uninterested in cultivating a number of traditional political skills — among them a sense of discretion and at least the semblance of self-control — but he has an uncanny feel for political symbolism, especially when it comes to the role of manufacturing in the United States. Factory work provides a diminishing share of working-class jobs: There were 43,000 iron and steelworkers last year, compared with almost 2 million hospital and home health aides. But to hear President Trump tell it, the factory workers are the ones who matter most. Just last week, he declared steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, tweeting that “trade wars are good, and easy to win.” Joshua B. Freeman’s rich and ambitious “Behemoth: A History of the Factory and the Making of the Modern World” depicts a world in retreat that still looms large in the national imagination. “Behemoth” is more than an economic history, or a chronicle of architectural feats and labor movements. Freeman, a professor at Queens College and the Graduate Center of CUNY, traces the rise of the factory and how it became entwined with Enlightenment ideas of progress — “the notion that through human effort and rationality the world could be transformed toward greater abundance, well-being and moral order.” Factories weren’t always imbued with such lofty ideals. They were initially devised “to take advantage of mundane commercial opportunities,” Freeman writes. He dates the first factory to 1721: a silk mill, built in Derby, England. In the decade after it opened, Daniel Defoe paid it a visit, declaring it “a Curiosity of a very extraordinary Nature.” The proliferation of these curiosities, culminating in the Industrial Revolution, took some time. Obtaining machinery and technical know-how often entailed some trade espionage, before the British government took an active hand in promoting industrial development. Labor discipline was another matter. In the farming and domestic work that people had been doing for generations, “intense activity alternated with slack times,” whereas factory production was repetitive and continuous, requiring “coordinated activity by dozens or hundreds of workers, who were expected to start and stop work at the same time, day after day.” Now that factory work and stable, blue-collar jobs are such potent sources of nostalgia, it can be hard to recall how truly disruptive the manufacturing age was. Freeman does a superb job of reminding us. For an agrarian society like England, the factory generated a wistfulness for the bucolic agricultural past. The “dark Satanic Mills” bemoaned by William Blake were powered by steam and coal-fired boilers that belched smoke and soot. Seventy-hour work weeks were common. Male workers chafed at the constant supervision on the factory floor, and owners preferred not to employ men, anyway. “Today, in the United States, factories are associated with masculinity,” Freeman writes, “but in their early days they were spaces largely occupied by women and children.” Some of the details recounted here are familiar, though still appalling. In the 19th century, textile mills in New England — which were supposed to be gentler than the cruel depredations of the Old World — employed children as young as 4. Factory workers in Britain overwhelmed urban areas, crowding together in squalor. A Manchester official described streets “so covered with refuse and excrementitious matter as to be almost impassable from depth of mud, and intolerable from stench.” As Freeman shows, what started inauspiciously became an engine for material abundance and, in the cases of the United States and the Soviet Union, a source of national pride. Factories, especially steel mills, became the behemoths of the book’s title, consolidations of equipment and labor on a massive scale. Freeman suggests the awe that these enormous structures must have inspired, describing how dignitaries attending the opening of a steel mill in 19th-century Maryland “rode in decorated gondola cars along the route iron ore would take,” ascending to a height of eight stories. Unlike the textile worker, who brought to mind wan images of a young woman or “a sickly child,” steelworkers were often portrayed “as intensely masculine, often bare-chested, with muscles rippling.” With size and strength came strife too, as steel mills became sites for a bitter class war. Start-up costs were high, so a few big firms dominated the industry. Unions organized in response. Steel magnates like Andrew Carnegie resented any incursions on their freedom to set wages and working conditions at will; they wanted the right to squeeze labor to maintain profitability. The Homestead strike of 1892 turned into a literal conflagration, as steelworkers in Pennsylvania set the Monongahela River on fire. Freeman handles all of this material with the seriousness it deserves. If “Behemoth” can feel a little slow-going at times, that’s partly because of the knottiness of the history Freeman lays out, as well as his honorable refusal to resort to simplistic notions of grand progress or portentous doom. He shows how Henry Ford’s assembly-line innovations rendered his company both dominant and vulnerable: Switching to a new product in 1927 from the Model T required a wholesale overhaul of equipment and processes, costing Ford today’s equivalent of a cool $3.5 billion. Gigant industrialism in the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc showed its own seams and contradictions; for all the talk of a workers’ paradise, the Soviets eventually criminalized absenteeism, tardiness and “quitting without permission,” controlling labor in ways that would have made the most ruthless capitalist proud. Toward the end of “Behemoth,” Freeman finally arrives in China and Vietnam, where the factory system is still flourishing. Unlike the 20th-century behemoths of the United States, which were publicly showcased as marvels of ingenuity and industry, these new factories keep much of their work hidden. Freeman says Foxconn City in Shenzhen, China, might well be the largest factory ever, though the number of employees is hard to pin down: perhaps as many as 400,000 workers, making sleek and expensive gadgets like Apple’s iPhone. A spate of worker suicides at Foxconn captured the world’s attention in 2010 — at least for a while, though none of Foxconn’s major clients stopped using it. Nor did reports of Foxconn’s merciless and degrading environment put a dent in demand for Apple’s coveted products. Instead of substantively changing its production regime, Foxconn surrounded its factory buildings with yellow netting, to catch despairing workers before they hit the ground. Our brave new world of consumer goods is now fabricated in “bland, boring structures,” Freeman writes, designed for grim functionality as opposed to showing off: “Rather than representing an enlargement of the human spirit, modern factory giants often seem to symbolize its diminishment.” “Behemoth” doesn’t romanticize the earlier incarnations of gigantic factories, but Freeman understands why some people did — and still do.

technology,"By Reuters SEOUL/SINGAPORE — Investors in global chipmakers have had a rocky ride in the last few months on worries about a slowing smartphone market, but a clamor for more video content from consumers is underpinning buoyant sales for memory-chip makers. Indeed, the earnings reports of various chipmakers and smartphone companies in the past month tell a more interesting story beyond the cooling in phone shipment volumes: smartphone makers are cramming their devices with memory to satisfy the increasing demands of consumers.  A case in point is last week's quarterly report from Apple Inc. The Cupertino, California-based company said the iPhone X was the most popular iPhone model in the March quarter - the first cycle ever where the costliest iPhone was also the most sought after.  More upbeat assessments from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Qualcomm Inc , and Franco-Italian company STMicroelectronics, have also eased concerns. Samsung last month forecast strong sales for ""high-density"" chips that have more processing power and bigger storage capacity - demand that will help it weather a decline in overall smartphone shipments as consumers are willing to pay for costlier and faster models that allow them to easily watch and store large amounts of video. ""Even as the number of smartphone shipments slow down, each smartphone will contain memory chips with bigger capacity and better performance, which, for memory chip makers, makes up for a slowdown in the number of total smartphones,"" said Kim Rok-ho, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment. That puts into perspective a warning by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) of softer smartphone sales, which was partly responsible for the recent selloff in Apple and other chipmakers. The broader concerns about a slowdown in the chip market appear to have eased as well.  The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, a proxy for global chipmakers that fell sharply from its peak in mid-March on initial iPhone sales concerns, has stabilized in the past two weeks, posting a 4.4 percent rise so far this year. PURE-PLAY MEMORY  The $122 billion memory chip industry enjoyed an unprecedented boom since mid-2016, expanding nearly 70 percent in 2017 alone, thanks to robust growth of smartphones and cloud services that require more powerful chips that can store loads of data.  The pace of growth is set to more than halve as memory-chip prices come off their highs, but the outlook remains strong for pure-play memory chipmakers such as Micron Technology Inc and SK Hynix. Micron's shares have risen 18 percent this year and Hynix's stock has gained 8.5 percent.  Revenue at Micron, for instance, has grown at an average rate of about 65 percent in the two quarters it has reported this year, and analysts expect it to grow at an average of 30 percent for the rest of the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Micron and Hynix both trade at roughly 4 times forward 12-month earnings against a sector median of 16.7, suggesting that the stocks have room to grow.  Other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Texas Instruments, which are less leveraged to the smartphone market, including those that sell to carmakers, industrial, bitcoin, and gaming companies are well set up too. PROCESSOR CHIPS VULNERABLE All the same, the slowdown in smartphone shipments is bad news for chipmakers that design microprocessors: each phone needs just one microprocessor chip versus rapid growth of memory content in devices.  Global smartphone shipments fell 2 percent in the first quarter, following a 9 percent drop in the fourth quarter, according to market research firm StrategyAnalytics. Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon processors power many popular smartphone models, recently showed just how far it is willing to go to hedge against a slowdown after revenue from its key licensing business slumped 44 percent in the latest quarter. The company, which charges a fee for its chip patents based on a percentage of the selling price of a smartphone, said it would cap the phone price used to calculate that fee at $400. More expensive phones, which can sell for $1,000, would still be treated as $400 for the purpose of the Qualcomm license fee.  TSMC, whose fortunes are more closely tied with the broader smartphone industry as it is the world's largest contract chipmaker, felt the slowdown more acutely in the latest quarter. Qualcomm and TSMC stocks are down 21 percent and 2.6 percent respectively so far this year.  ""The spending cycle (by chipmakers for investment) is continuing, but there may still be volatility similar to the correction in 2015,"" Tammy Qiu, an analyst at Berenberg said in a note to clients.

technology,"By Reuters (Reuters) - Apple reports second-quarter results later on Tuesday, following warnings from some chipmakers who supply the world's biggest smartphone makers about demand for the iPhone and other top-end models. Shares in the world's biggest publicly traded company have slid along with many others in the technology sector this year. Apple's 2.4 percent drop year-to-date in 2018 is its steepest since 2016, although in that year the company had already reported by the end of April. The latest hit to the stock came in mid-April after a warning on global demand from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, the world's largest contract chipmaker, reminiscent of one from Cirrus Logic Inc five years ago. Apple is estimated to have sold 53 million iPhones from January through March, a 4.4 percent increase year over year, according to financial data and analytics firm FactSet.(Apple iPhone sales: https://reut.rs/2rbKV2M) Total revenue is expected to have risen 15 percent to $60.84 billion, with net profit jumping 24 percent to $13.68 billion, or $2.68 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.(Apple YTD gains in the last 5 years: https://reut.rs/2jjYJE7) However, the iPhone sales estimate is down 9.4 percent from three months back, amid reports of waning demand. The revenue estimate has fallen 7.4 percent and profit estimate by 3.8 percent.  Along with the estimates, its stock price has also slid this year, weakening the chances of Apple becoming the first company to top $1 trillion in value by market capitalization.(Apple: Race to trillion: https://reut.rs/2ra3LHM) The stock has topped the $900-billion mark four times in 2018, including as recently as last week, before each time falling back.(Apple PE ratio: https://reut.rs/2radBcu) Apple, hard to characterise as an out and out manufacturer or pure technology play, currently trades at 13.5 times its estimated earnings for the next twelve months, higher than its five-year average of close to 13. That is almost double the equivalent number for its main phone industry competitor, Samsung Electronics, but below U.S. tech peers Alphabet or Microsoft.

technology,"Artificial intelligence video tools make it relatively easy to put one person’s face on another person’s body with few traces of manipulation. I tried it on myself. What could go wrong?  By Kevin Roose The scene opened on a room with a red sofa, a potted plant and the kind of bland modern art you’d see on a therapist’s wall.  In the room was Michelle Obama, or someone who looked exactly like her. Wearing a low-cut top with a black bra visible underneath, she writhed lustily for the camera and flashed her unmistakable smile. Then, the former first lady’s doppelgänger began to strip. The video, which appeared on the online forum Reddit, was what’s known as a “deepfake” — an ultrarealistic fake video made with artificial intelligence software. It was created using a program called FakeApp, which superimposed Mrs. Obama’s face onto the body of a pornographic film actress. The hybrid was uncanny — if you didn’t know better, you might have thought it was really her. Until recently, realistic computer-generated video was a laborious pursuit available only to big-budget Hollywood productions or cutting-edge researchers. Social media apps like Snapchat include some rudimentary face-morphing technology.  But in recent months, a community of hobbyists has begun experimenting with more powerful tools, including FakeApp — a program that was built by an anonymous developer using open-source software written by Google. FakeApp makes it free and relatively easy to create realistic face swaps and leave few traces of manipulation. Since a version of the app appeared on Reddit in January, it has been downloaded more than 120,000 times, according to its creator. Deepfakes are one of the newest forms of digital media manipulation, and one of the most obviously mischief-prone. It’s not hard to imagine this technology’s being used to smear politicians, create counterfeit revenge porn or frame people for crimes. Lawmakers have already begun to worry about how deepfakes could be used for political sabotage and propaganda.  Even on morally lax sites like Reddit, deepfakes have raised eyebrows. Recently, FakeApp set off a panic after Motherboard, the technology site, reported that people were using it to create pornographic deepfakes of celebrities. Pornhub, Twitter and other sites quickly banned the videos, and Reddit closed a handful of deepfake groups, including one with nearly 100,000 members. Before the Reddit deepfake groups were closed, they hosted a mixture of users trading video-editing tips and showing off their latest forgeries. A post titled “3D face reconstruction for additional angles” sat next to videos with titles like “(Not) Olivia Wilde playing with herself.” Some users on Reddit defended deepfakes and blamed the media for overhyping their potential for harm. Others moved their videos to alternative platforms, rightly anticipating that Reddit would crack down under its rules against nonconsensual pornography. And a few expressed moral qualms about putting the technology into the world.  Then, they kept making more.  The deepfake creator community is now in the internet’s shadows. But while out in the open, it gave an unsettling peek into the future.  “This is turning into an episode of Black Mirror,” wrote one Reddit user. The post raised the ontological questions at the heart of the deepfake debate: Does a naked image of Person A become a naked image of Person B if Person B’s face is superimposed in a seamless and untraceable way? In a broader sense, on the internet, what is the difference between representation and reality?  The user then signed off with a shrug: “Godspeed rebels.” After lurking for several weeks in Reddit’s deepfake community, I decided to see how easy it was to create a (safe for work, nonpornographic) deepfake using my own face. I started by downloading FakeApp and enlisting two technical experts to help me. The first was Mark McKeague, a colleague in The New York Times’s research and development department. The second was a deepfake creator I found through Reddit, who goes by the nickname Derpfakes.  Because of the controversial nature of deepfakes, Derpfakes would not give his or her real name. Derpfakes started posting deepfake videos on YouTube a few weeks ago, specializing in humorous offerings like Nicolas Cage playing Superman. The account has also posted some how-to videos on deepfake creation. What I learned is that making a deepfake isn’t simple. But it’s not rocket science, either. The first step is to find, or rent, a moderately powerful computer. FakeApp uses a suite of machine learning tools called TensorFlow, which was developed by Google’s A.I. division and released to the public in 2015. The software teaches itself to perform image-recognition tasks through trial and error. The more processing power on hand, the faster it works. To get more speed, Mark and I used a remote server rented through Google Cloud Platform. It provided enough processing power to cut the time frame down to hours, rather than the days or weeks it might take on my laptop. Once Mark set up the remote server and loaded FakeApp on it, we were on to the next step: data collection. Picking the right source data is crucial. Short video clips are easier to manipulate than long clips, and scenes shot at a single angle produce better results than scenes with multiple angles. Genetics also help. The more the faces resemble each other, the better.  I’m a brown-haired white man with a short beard, so Mark and I decided to try several other brown-haired, stubbled white guys. We started with Ryan Gosling. (Aim high, right?) I also sent Derpfakes, my outsourced Reddit expert, several video options to choose from. Next, we took several hundred photos of my face, and gathered images of Mr. Gosling’s face using a clip from a recent TV appearance. FakeApp uses these images to train the deep learning model and teach it to emulate our facial expressions.  To get the broadest photo set possible, I twisted my head at different angles, making as many different faces as I could. Mark then used a program to crop those images down, isolating just our faces, and manually deleted any blurred or badly cropped photos. He then fed the frames into FakeApp. In all, we used 417 photos of me, and 1,113 of Mr. Gosling. When the images were ready, Mark pressed “start” on FakeApp, and the training began. His computer screen filled with images of my face and Mr. Gosling’s face, as the program tried to identify patterns and similarities.  About eight hours later, after our model had been sufficiently trained, Mark used FakeApp to finish putting my face on Mr. Gosling’s body. The video was blurry and bizarre, and Mr. Gosling’s face occasionally flickered into view. Only the legally blind would mistake the person in the video for me.  We did better with a clip of Chris Pratt, the scruffy star of “Jurassic World,” whose face shape is a little more similar to mine. For this test, Mark used a bigger data set — 1,861 photos of me, 1,023 of him — and let the model run overnight.  A few days later, Derpfakes, who had also been training a model, sent me a finished deepfake made using the footage I had sent and a video of the actor Jake Gyllenhaal. This one was much more lifelike, a true hybrid that mixed my facial features with his hair, beard and body. Derpfakes repeated the process with videos of Jimmy Kimmel and Liev Schreiber, both of which turned out well. As an experienced deepfake creator, Derpfakes had a more intuitive sense of which source videos would produce a clean result, and more experience with the subtle blending and tweaking that takes place at the end of the deepfake process. In all, our deepfake experiment took three days and cost $85.96 in Google Cloud Platform credits. That seemed like a small price to pay for stardom. After the experiment, I reached out to the anonymous creator of FakeApp through an email address on its website. I wanted to know how it felt to create a cutting-edge A.I. tool, only to have it gleefully co-opted by ethically challenged pornographers. A man wrote back, identifying himself as a software developer in Maryland. Like Derpfakes, the man would not give me his full name, and instead went by his first initial, N. He said he had created FakeApp as a creative experiment and was chagrined to see Reddit’s deepfake community use it for ill.  “I joined the community based around these algorithms when it was very small (less than 500 people),” he wrote, “and as soon as I saw the results I knew this was brilliant tech that should be accessible to anyone who wants to play around with it. I figured I’d take a shot at putting together an easy-to-use package to accomplish that.” N. said he didn’t support the use of FakeApp to create nonconsensual pornography or other abusive content. And he said he agreed with Reddit’s decision to ban explicit deepfakes. But he defended the product. “I’ve given it a lot of thought,” he said, “and ultimately I’ve decided I don’t think it’s right to condemn the technology itself — which can of course be used for many purposes, good and bad.” FakeApp is somewhat finicky and hard to use, but it’s easy to imagine it improving quickly. N. said that in the future, FakeApp could be used by all kinds of people to bring high-budget special effects to their personal projects. Deep learning algorithms, he added, were going to be important in the future, not only as stand-alone apps but as powerful components of many tech products. “It’s precisely the things that make them so powerful and useful that make them so scary,” he said. “There’s really no limit to what you can apply it to with a little imagination.” On the day of the school shooting last month in Parkland, Fla., a screenshot of a BuzzFeed News article, “Why We Need to Take Away White People’s Guns Now More Than Ever,” written by a reporter named Richie Horowitz, began making the rounds on social media. The whole thing was fake. No BuzzFeed employee named Richie Horowitz exists, and no article with that title was ever published on the site. But the doctored image pulsed through right-wing outrage channels and was boosted by activists on Twitter. It wasn’t an A.I.-generated deepfake, or even a particularly sophisticated Photoshop job, but it did the trick. Online misinformation, no matter how sleekly produced, spreads through a familiar process once it enters our social distribution channels. The hoax gets 50,000 shares, and the debunking an hour later gets 200. The carnival barker gets an algorithmic boost on services like Facebook and YouTube, while the expert screams into the void. There’s no reason to believe that deepfake videos will operate any differently. People will share them when they’re ideologically convenient and dismiss them when they’re not. The dupes who fall for satirical stories from The Onion will be fooled by deepfakes, and the scrupulous people who care about the truth will find ways to detect and debunk them.  “There’s no choice,” said Hao Li, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Southern California. Mr. Li, who is also the founder of Pinscreen, a company that uses artificial intelligence to create lifelike 3-D avatars, said the weaponization of A.I. was inevitable and would require a sudden shift in public awareness. “I see this as the next form of communication,” he said. “I worry that people will use it to blackmail others, or do bad things. You have to educate people that this is possible.” So, O.K. Here I am, telling you this: An A.I. program powerful enough to turn Michelle Obama into a pornography star, or transform a schlubby newspaper columnist into Jake Gyllenhaal, is in our midst. Manipulated video will soon become far more commonplace. And there’s probably nothing we can do except try to bat the fakes down as they happen, pressure social media companies to fight misinformation aggressively, and trust our eyes a little less every day.

technology,"Climate Fwd: By Hiroko Tabuchi, Livia Albeck-Ripka and Kendra Pierre-Louis Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. This week, we ask auto companies for their climate positions, we talk with the oceanographer Sylvia Earle, and we look forward to spring (during a snowstorm here in New York). By Hiroko Tabuchi At auto shows and on dealership floors, automakers are quick to talk about the latest green technology — electric vehicles, hybrids, even hydrogen cars. But in Washington, the industry is sending a different message. Last month, one of the largest lobbying groups argued in a regulatory filing that the basic science behind climate change is not to be trusted. In the same filing, the lobbying group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, also cast doubt on the negative effects of tailpipe pollution on human health. Both arguments go against well-established, widely accepted scientific research. And they represent a significant escalation of the industry’s fight to roll back aggressive rules adopted by the Obama administration to rein in tailpipe emissions, a major contributor to air pollution and global warming. The industry argues those rules cost too much and must be relaxed. Quoting news articles and studies, the Alliance’s filing suggests that climate scientists may be “tuning” their models to achieve desired results. “Nearly every model has been calibrated precisely to the 20th century climate records — otherwise it would have ended up in the trash,” reads a quote from a 2016 story in Science magazine on climate modeling. “Choices and compromises made during the tuning exercise may significantly affect model results,” reads another quote from a 2017 study in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. But the Alliance appears to have cherry-picked such quotes to support its argument against the tailpipe emission standards. “Those quotes are accurate, but they are selective and do not accurately represent the entirety of the news story,” Paul Voosen, the author of the Science article, said in an email. Any uncertainty in climate modeling, he said, “is about the speed of warming — how fast sea level and temperature will rise — not uncertainty about warming’s direction or cause.” “No, climate scientists do not tune their data to support their conclusions,” added Frédéric Hourdin, the lead author of the Bulletin study and a researcher at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique in Paris. The Alliance’s document also quotes a study in the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, which says that “most of the hundreds of papers on the relationship between air quality and mortality have serious statistical problems.” Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology has been criticized for publishing studies funded by the tobacco industry that blur the links between tobacco smoke and health. The publication lists Dr. Gio B. Gori, an epidemiologist and former tobacco industry consultant now at the Health Policy Center in Bethesda, Md., as its editor. Calls to the center, a private company with no website, went unanswered. “This is a deliberate attempt to cast doubt on this science,” said Janice Nolen, assistant vice president for national policy at the American Lung Association. “It’s well established that particulate matter shortens human life. It’s a settled issue.” Automakers have a long history of fighting regulations on tailpipe emissions. But in 2009, they seemed to turn over a new leaf, working with the Obama administration to design new emissions standards that are some of the toughest in the world. But just a day after Donald J. Trump’s election in 2016, the Alliance wrote to the president-elect and urged a reassessment of emissions rules the group said posed a “substantial challenge” for the auto industry. The Trump administration is now reviewing those rules, with a decision expected at the end of the month. “Automakers have invested billions of dollars to address the climate challenge by successfully increasing fuel efficiency and reducing carbon emissions,” Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance, said in a statement. She declined to comment on whether automakers accept climate science. We asked the automakers the Alliance represents for their own positions on climate change. General Motors, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, Volkswagen, Toyota, Mazda, Mitsubishi Motors, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and Porsche all either did not respond or referred the query to the Alliance. A BMW spokeswoman, Rebecca Kiehne, said the automaker was committed to reducing emissions through improvements in fuel economy but did not address climate science. Honda, which is not an Alliance member, was the only automaker we contacted that clearly acknowledged the reality of human-caused climate change. A spokesman, Chris Martin, said Honda supported the stricter Obama-era rules as well as “efforts to curb climate change caused by carbon emissions.” By Livia Albeck-Ripka Sylvia Earle, 82, is an oceanographer who has spent thousands of hours underwater studying corals, algae and wildlife. She was the first person to walk untethered on the ocean floor a quarter of a mile deep and once lived underwater for two weeks in a NASA experiment. She also spent two years as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s chief scientist. I interviewed Dr. Earle to ask her whether, having seen what she has seen, she thinks we have time to mitigate climate change. (The following has been condensed and edited for clarity.) What is the single most profound change you’ve witnessed in a lifetime diving?  There was a period in the 1970s when I dived in an area called Lee Stocking Island, in the Bahamas. We got to know the individual fish and there was one giant boulder, a big brain coral, that was just thriving with life. It was a destination: “Let’s go see Rainbow Reef and admire that monstrous coral.” It was in 1980 that it turned into a snowball [it bleached]. It was shocking. That was climate change in action. What do you say to people who are not convinced by the evidence? I think about poor Galileo, 500 years ago or so, when he had evidence that Earth is not the center of the universe and was ostracized. Now, we have evidence that we are totally dependent on the natural systems that hold the planet steady within the temperature range that is safe for us. You can measure the shrinking Arctic and Antarctic ice. Half the coral reefs have either gone or are in a state of sharp decline. I think it’s getting easier, because the ocean is beginning to speak for herself. You helped persuade President George W. Bush to create an ocean monument 100 times the size of Yosemite. Now, the Trump administration is trying to shrink similar protected areas. How does that make you feel? Quoting a former Republican president who was not widely celebrated for his environmental ethic, Ronald Reagan: Protecting the environment is not a liberal or conservative thing, it’s just common sense. He at least could see the connection between the economy and the environment. When you lose the quality of a place environmentally — the trees, the water, the space, the air — there are economic and human social consequences. It’s taken a longer time for people to realize that the ocean is vast and resilient, but it’s not too big to fail. What do you tell people who tell you that they don’t have hope, or they don’t know what they can do? This is the best time ever to be around, because we have the power of knowing. Look in the mirror to recognize your personal power. It’s a matter of using what you’ve got. Take a kid out to some wild place and see the world through that child’s eyes. Look at the future and imagine you’re there, 50 years out. We’ve reached a time when we really have to choose between our wants and our needs, and we need a planet that works. By Kendra Pierre-Louis Last week the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its Spring Outlook, a prediction of broad weather patterns expected in the United States over the next three months. But for much of the country, that look through a climate crystal ball was like looking out the window. Many of the weather patterns in the forecast were already underway before spring’s arrival this week. For example, NOAA’s outlook for the Ohio River Valley and lower Mississippi River calls for minor to moderate flooding over the next few weeks. But the Mississippi has already reached flood stage, a month earlier than usual. Similarly, the Ohio River flooded in February, which was one of the wettest on record in the region. Even as those regions dealt with too much water, too little water plagued Southern California and the Southwest. Ordinarily winter in the region is a relatively wet season, building up water supplies. But this year’s winter ended in drought, likely aided by the La Niña conditions that began at the end of 2017. La Niña is the yin to El Niño’s yang. During a La Niña year, winter temperatures are warmer and drier than normal in the South and cooler than normal in the Northwest. NOAA predicts that parts of California, the Great Plains and the Southeast will remain in drought through at least June. NOAA also expects that the spring will be warmer than usual for the southern two-thirds of the United States, stretching from California into the Northeast. This comes on the heels of a February that was 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average nationwide, and a January that was 2.1 degrees above average. That February was warmer than average may come as a surprise to Northeastern states now slogging through the fourth nor’easter in a month. It’s perhaps less surprising to those in northern Alaska. On Feb. 20 the temperature in Utqiagvik, formerly known as Barrow and the northernmost town in the United States, was 40 degrees warmer than the historical average.

technology,"By James B. Stewart Few investors had more at stake in Broadcom’s $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the chip maker Qualcomm than Jerome L. Dodson, the founder and chief executive of Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, and chief portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor mutual fund. Endeavor owns 8.3 million Qualcomm shares, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. A week ago the shares were worth over $500 million and accounted for nearly 10 percent of Endeavor’s assets, a highly concentrated position. By pursuing a mix of value and socially responsible investing — avoiding companies that harm the environment, and favoring companies that treat their employees well — Mr. Dodson has emerged as one of his generation’s most successful investors. Morningstar ranks his Endeavor fund first among large capitalization blended mutual funds over 10-, five- and three-year periods. Then, this week, President Trump killed Broadcom’s takeover bid on national security grounds, and Qualcomm shares plunged. They dropped more than 5 percent on Tuesday, a $25 million hit to the Endeavor fund. Yet when I spoke to Mr. Dodson this week, he was not only serenely unruffled by the president’s decision — he applauded it. “There’s no doubt I would have made a quick profit if the Broadcom deal had gone through,” he said. “But as a shareholder, I voted against it.” That’s partly because, “as a citizen, I didn’t like the deal,” he said. Broadcom typically slashes costs, especially research and development, and the company said it would do exactly that if it acquired Qualcomm. “In the long run that’s not good for the country or for society,” Mr. Dodson said. He agreed with the Trump administration’s assessment that, by cutting Qualcomm’s research costs, Broadcom would be assisting Chinese rivals in the global race for dominance in 5G communications technology. But as an investor, his reasoning can pretty much be reduced to one word: Apple. Apple has traditionally been one of Qualcomm’s biggest customers, along with Samsung and every other major handset company. But the two technology giants are also embroiled in an epic battle over licensing fees for Qualcomm’s patented technology, with profound implications not only for Qualcomm’s business model and Apple’s profit margins, but for the future of wireless communication. If Qualcomm and Apple can just bury the hatchet, Mr. Dodson reasons, Qualcomm’s revenues would soar, and its stock price would climb well past Broadcom’s offering price of $79 a share. By Mr. Dodson’s reckoning, once Apple resumes paying Qualcomm, the chip maker will be worth at least $84 a share, “which is why Broadcom’s offer didn’t really engage my attention,” he said. That, however, is a big “if,” given the intractable positions both sides have staked out. At the heart of the dispute is the way Qualcomm calculates the licensing fee it charges customers, which is a percentage of the cost of the net selling price of the entire handset — and not the price of the chip. That means that Apple, a high-cost producer whose iPhone X sells for as much as $1,000, has paid much higher licensing fees than low-cost competitors using exactly the same chip set. Apple has called the arrangement an “extortion scheme.” It infuriates Apple that Qualcomm has, in effect, been subsidizing its low-cost competitors, including the very Chinese companies that Mr. Trump says he is so concerned about. Qualcomm has countered that its intellectual property makes many of the iPhones’ distinctive features possible, features that low-cost competitors haven’t replicated, and therefore Qualcomm deserves a percentage of the cost of the entire device. Mr. Dodson made little immediate headway when he met with a delegation of top Qualcomm officials late last month and pressed his case for a settlement with Apple. The officials, including the chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, and Paul Jacobs, a Qualcomm founder and, until recently, executive chairman, visited Mr. Dodson in San Francisco to make their case against the Broadcom bid. In Mr. Dodson’s account of the meeting, he urged the Qualcomm executives to settle with Apple rather than risk alienating it as a customer over the long term. But Qualcomm officials said that Apple was demanding more than they were prepared to give and that, on an engineering level, relations with Apple remained good. They assured him that eventually they would reach a settlement, revenues would normalize and Qualcomm stock would respond. Still, “I’d like to see them budge” on the licensing issue, Mr. Dodson said. “I can see Apple’s point.” But if Qualcomm stopped charging Apple a percentage of the device’s cost, it would probably have to extend similar terms to all its major customers. It recently amended its agreement with Samsung without abandoning its approach to license fees. At the meeting, Qualcomm officials told Mr. Dodson they offered Apple similar terms, but Apple rejected them. A Qualcomm spokeswoman declined to comment, as did an Apple spokeswoman. Long-simmering tensions between Qualcomm and Apple reached a boiling point in 2016, when Qualcomm halted rebates it was giving Apple. Qualcomm claimed Apple had violated the terms of the rebate agreement by cooperating with South Korea’s investigation into what Samsung and others said was exclusionary conduct by Qualcomm. Apple responded by withholding the license fees it paid manufacturers of iPhones, who in turn stopped passing on the payments to Qualcomm. Lawsuits and counterclaims erupted, and Qualcomm reduced its revenue estimates by $500 million a year. While Apple has continued to buy and deploy the latest Qualcomm chips, it also reached out to a rival chip maker, Intel, which began supplying an alternative to Qualcomm’s chip for the iPhone 7. (That phone, the iPhone 8 and the X may contain either a Qualcomm or an Intel chip.) Qualcomm claims that Apple has compromised the performance of Qualcomm-equipped handsets in order to mask their superiority over the Intel-equipped phones. (Both Intel and Apple have vehemently denied the claims.) Numerous lawsuits are now well underway in the United States, with some expected to go to trial later this year. Regulators in the European Union, Taiwan, South Korea and China have ruled that Qualcomm’s licensing practices are unlawful and have levied fines, decisions that Qualcomm is appealing. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission is conducting its own investigation. While armies of patent lawyers fight over the rival claims, investors have already rendered a verdict. Qualcomm shares, after peaking at more than $80 in 2014, dropped by nearly 50 percent, hitting a low of $44 in 2016. Qualcomm’s precipitous decline is what attracted Mr. Dodson’s attention along with other so-called value investors, who look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. He said his fund’s average cost per share for its Qualcomm position was about $56, so the fund was still ahead even after the deal collapsed this week. On Thursday, Qualcomm was trading at around $60. Still, Qualcomm’s performance has knocked the Endeavor fund from its perch at the top of the Morningstar rankings. So far this year, it’s 61st. Now that Mr. Trump has rescued Qualcomm from the imminent threat of a Broadcom takeover, its financial prospects — and share price — will largely follow the twists and turns in the Apple standoff. While Mr. Dodson remains optimistic about the outcome, that doesn’t mean he’s against all potential takeovers of Qualcomm. Last week, there were rumors that Intel might launch a bid for Broadcom, which made Mr. Dodson wonder: “Why doesn’t it bid for Qualcomm? If Intel bought it, Qualcomm would be in good hands.” “As a citizen, I’d be very comfortable with that,” he said.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
technology,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 6, 2018
 Good Tuesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • Tronc nears a deal to sell L.A. Times. • Dow surges 500 points. • Reasons not to worry about the recent sell-off. • Disney easily exceeds Wall Street’s expectations. • Snap jumps 20 percent after earnings. • Clayton: “There’s nothing that came out of this that concerns me.” • Is algorithmic trading to blame for Monday’s plunge? Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. The owner of The Los Angeles Times is close to a deal to sell the newspaper to Patrick Soon-Shiong, a billionaire Los Angeles doctor, two people familiar with the negotiations said Tuesday. The $500 million deal comes amid months of turmoil at The Times, including upheaval in the editorial and management ranks. Advertisement The transaction would include The Times and The San Diego Union-Tribune, these people said. Dr. Soon-Shiong is a major shareholder in Tronc, the parent company of The Times. Advertisement A deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday but could still fall apart, the people said. Tronc is likely to use the sale proceeds to pay down its debt. Dr. Soon-Shiong, the founder, chief executive and chairman of NantHealth, a health care company, was in a public feud last year with Michael W. Ferro Jr., Tronc’s nonexecutive chairman, as they vied to increase their stakes in the company in apparent attempts to outmaneuver each other for control. — Sydney Ember After days of sometimes wild moves in stock markets, investors on Wall Street refocused on the ongoing strength in the American economy as shares of consumer companies helped lead broad indexes higher. A sometimes-panicky global market sell-off — begun Monday when the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost more than 4 percent, its worst decline since August 2011 — dissipated through the day, and the S.&P. 500 ended Tuesday’s session up by about 1.7 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained about 2.3 percent. The consumer discretionary sector of the S.&P. 500 jumped by more than 2 percent, pulled higher by strength in well-known consumer-facing companies like Amazon, Netflix and Home Depot. General Motors also rose after reporting strong earnings and strong demand for its pickup trucks and SUVs. Investors appeared to reassess whether the previous day’s violent decline—the S.&P. suffered its worst decline since August 2011—reflected actual fundamentals or was merely a long-overdue outbreak of investor jitters. For months, markets seemed to sleepwalk higher, as measures of volatility—the ups and downs of stock prices—hit historically low levels. Investors appeared to grow accustomed to an economic backdrop in which growth and inflation remained lackluster, a state of affairs that ensured powerful global central banks would continue to support markets with a range of policies. Advertisement But the peaceful climb ended over the past week amid worries that solid economic growth in the United States and abroad could be showing early signals of growing inflation pressure. Those concerns drove yields on long-term Treasury bonds sharply higher in recent weeks, as economic data—such as the U.S. jobs report on Friday—showed wages growing at their fastest clip in years. — Matt Phillips The Walt Disney Company on Tuesday became the latest prominent company to report solid earnings amidst the market turmoil. The strong numbers support the belief that plunging stock markets do not reflect weakness in the real economy. Disney made $1.89 per share in the last three months of 2017, after excluding a tax benefit. That number is 22 percent higher than the $1.55 per share earnings in the same period of 2016. It is also well in excess of the $1.61 per share that Wall Street analysts had forecast for the latest quarter. Disney did best in its parks and resorts business, which reported $1.35 billion of operating income, which was 21 percent higher than the year-earlier period. The earlier period’s results were somewhat depressed by the impact of Hurricane Matthew, Disney said. In its press release, the company noted that higher profits at its domestic parks and resorts were driven by an increase in guest spending and an increase in attendance, which underscores consumers’ willingness to spend more. On the other hand, the company said parks and resorts are dealing with higher labor costs and other expenses. That may not be lost on investors who are starting to see inflation as a threat to stock prices. — Peter Eavis The company reported earnings after the close that easily beat analysts’ expectations. The Numbers • Snap reported revenue rose 72 percent to $285.7 million, easily exceeding the $252.9 million expected by analysts. • The company lost 13 cents per share, below estimates of 16 cents a share. • Snap added 8.9 million daily active users for a total of 187 million, compared to the 184.2 million estimated. The Context Snap’s shares have struggled since its initial public offering in March 2017. The stock fell below its I.P.O price of $17 a share last summer and has remained below that level since. If Snap’s after-hours gains hold up on Wednesday, the stock will be on the cusp of crossing back over its I.P.O. level. Advertisement The stock market’s slide over the past week has given investors plenty of anxiety. Stocks have lost roughly $4 trillion in value. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 endured their worst point declines in their histories Monday and their largest percentage drops since 2011. C.B.O.E. Volatility Index surged more than 100 percent Monday, the biggest increase in its history. But there are reasons investors shouldn’t get too concerned. 1) Heading into the final hour of trading, the markets have rebounded strongly. The Dow has jumped 2 percent, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite are up 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent. That suggests that worst of the sell-off may be passed. 2) The outlook for economic growth is strong in the United States. The American economy grew 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter and the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker forecasts a 4 percent rise in the first quarter. 3) Corporate America’s bottom line is growing. With 50 percent of the companies in the S.&P. 500 having reported results, profits are on pace to grow 13.4 percent, according to FactSet. If that growth rate holds through the end of earnings, it would mark the third quarter in the past four that S.&P. 500 companies have reported a double-digit profits increase. 4) The sell-off comes after a big run-up in stocks. Until Monday, the Dow and the S.&P. 500 hadn’t endured a pullback of 5 percent in more than 400 sessions. Since 1929, a 5 percent decline happens every 92 days on average, according to Goldman Sachs. So stocks were arguably due for a selloff. But it should be noted that after Monday’s declines the Dow was at levels last seen in, well, mid-December and was up more than 30 percent since the 2016 election. Strategists over at Goldman Sachs wrote: “The stock market correction appears to be more technical and positioning-driven rather than fundamentally-based.We believe the fundamental drivers of the equity market remain intact and reiterate our S&P 500 year-end 2018 forecast of 2850.” The company, founded by Elon Musk, achieved a new milestone with a successful test launch of its Falcon Heavy rocket, the most powerful rocket in operation in the world today. Here’s a video of the launch: When stock markets are plunging, sober-minded investors try to gauge the underlying strength of bellwether companies, to see whether all the selling is justified. That is why many eyes will be on the earnings of the Walt Disney Company, which reports after the close of regular trading Tuesday. If the company releases stronger-than-expected results for the three months through the end of December, it will reinforce a general sense of optimism about corporate America . Advertisement Stellar results from Disney would add to a strong earnings report on Tuesday from General Motors, which helped push the company’s shares 3 percent higher. Micron Technology, a large maker of computer chips, on Monday upped its outlook for the current quarter. Its shares soared 7.7 percent on Tuesday. Though Disney is not a high growth company, its results offer insight into the strength of consumer spending. As a result, if the company reports earnings that are below the forecasts of Wall Street analysts, it may add to the unease among investors.. The numbers to watch: Analysts expect Disney to earn $1.61 per share, and take in $15.44 billion in revenue in the quarter, according to data from Bloomberg. Of course, a lot more companies are going to have to report strong earnings to convince investors to jump back into the stock market. One of the reasons that stocks rallied in recent months is that analysts are expecting a 20-percent plus jump in profits in 2018, an eye-popping rise. The more large companies that hit their numbers in this earnings season, the more likely the stock market will find a floor. — Peter Eavis At a hearing of the Senate banking committee on Tuesday, Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama asked the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about the market turmoil. “Is this perhaps more than an ordinary correction?” Mr. Shelby asked. Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C. said that he could not tell what had caused the big declines, but he said that the market infrastructure had held up well under the strain of heavy trading. “As I sit here today, there’s nothing that came out of this that concerns me,” Mr. Clayton said. Christopher Giancarlo, the chairman of the C.F.T.C. said that his staff had a late night on Monday checking in with all the exchanges, and had not heard anything that concerned them. Advertisement “The system worked as it was designed to do,” he said. — Nathaniel Popper Following a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that he has been in touch with market participants this week and that they are reacting in an orderly fashion and that there are no liquidity problems. He said it was possible that algorithmic trading was partially responsible for the recent volatility in the stock market. “I have heard from others that it has played a role, as there’s more programmed trading, this tends to have volatility in both directions,” he said. Despite that volatility, it does not appear that the Trump administration is ready to give up on the stock market as a measure of its success. “We’ve always been looking at the long-term impact of the stock market, it’s still up over 30 percent since the election and we continue to think American is a great place to do business,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We couldn’t be happier with companies’ response with more and more investments in the U.S.” — Alan Rappeport Asked about the roiled stock market at a House Financial Services Committee hearing on Tuesday, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said that the Trump administration was not concerned and that it remains focused on the long-term trajectory of the economy. “We are very focused on long-term economic growth, and we believe that the policies that we have enacted, including tax reform are very positive for long-term economic growth,” Mr. Mnuchin said. He said that he was closely monitoring for orderly market functioning and that there were “no systemic issues” that were reported to him. “I’m happy to report I got the green lights,” Mr. Mnuchin said. The Treasury secretary said that given how much the market has rallied in the last year, he does not think the recent drop in prices raises financial stability concerns. Advertisement Asked if the Trump administration will take the blame for the recent drop in stocks after taking credit for the rally, Mr. Mnuchin demurred. “I think we’ll still claim credit for the fact that it’s up over 30 percent since the election,” he said of the stock market.

View all New York Times newsletters. — Alan Rappeport When stock markets sell off as they have the past two trading sessions, there is often more than one cause. But one popular trade is taking a lot of blame for Monday’s plunge: short volatility. Investors had piled money into exchange-traded products designed to rise when the C.B.O.E. Volatility Index, or VIX, falls. The VIX, known as the market’s fear gauge, measures how volatile investors expect stock markets to be in the month ahead. Those wagers paid off handsomely, rising 180 percent last year as the VIX plumbed historic lows. That quickly reversed Monday. The VIX surged 117 percent in its biggest one-day jump on record and two short volatility exchange-traded product — VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange Traded Note, XIV, and Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Inverse ETN — endured heavy selling. The selling led Credit Suisse to say it is going to buy back XIV and after the bank has done that it will no longer exist. Nomura also said its Next Notes “would be redeemed at a steep discount to their closing price on Monday in Asia, crystallizing large losses for investors,” the WSJ reported. From Barclays: “In our opinion, the significant spike in the VIX index and futures yesterday was technical in nature and does not necessarily indicate a true increase in risk perception.” From Morgan Stanley: “The near bankruptcy of the inverse VIX ETPs will be a very negative headline, and the several billion dollar loss for holders, largely retail, will scare some out of the market or force liquidations of other products to raise cash.” From Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research: “ Assuming volatility-related ETFs really are a market structure “Achilles heel”, this will take days if not weeks to play out, and there could be other problems waiting in the wings.” — Stephen Grocer Stock markets around the world appear headed down for a third straight trading day, after yesterday’s 4 percent drop in the S.&P. 500. Here are the latest numbers: • Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 5 percent. • Japan’s Nikkei was down 4.7 percent. • The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 2 percent. • Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the VIX, is at its highest level in two and a half years. Advertisement And here’s some more context from our colleague Peter Eavis. The technical question: Has computer-driven unwinding of “Goldilocks” trades tied to peaceful market rises played a role here? The economic question: Economies are growing around the world, which is likely to mean rising wages and then, perhaps, inflation. So will central bankers have to raise rates more than previously expected? The political question: What does this mean for President Trump, who has touted stock market gains as a measure of his success? More from Ben White of Politico: “This is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,” said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. “Until now, Trump’s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she’s out the door and volatility is back.” There’s another way of thinking about Mr. Trump’s role, Andrew writes in his latest column: Investors believe his policies to stoke growth are going to work so well that they will overheat the economy, and force the Federal Reserve to try to slow things down. But don’t expect action from the newly sworn-in Fed chairman, Jay Powell — at least, not yet. A bit of humor, courtesy of our colleague Binyamin Appelbaum: Where Bitcoin was this morning: $6,628, down almost 16 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum’s Ether and Ripple’s XRP fell by double digits, too. What’s happening: Regulators are clamping down on digital money, and scams and hacks are eroding trust in it. More from Nathaniel Popper of the NYT: “Cryptocurrencies are almost a perfect vehicle for scams,” said Kevin Werbach, a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “The combination of credulous buyers and low barriers for scammers were bound to lead to a high level of fraud, if and when the money involved got large.” Next: The heads of the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are to talk Bitcoin with the Senate Banking Committee today. The House appears ready to vote on a stopgap bill; funding would otherwise expire at 12:01 a.m. on Friday. What it does: Pairs short-term funding for the government with long-term funding for the military. What it doesn’t do: Include the increase in domestic spending demanded by Democrats, particularly Senate Democrats. Nor does it address immigration, which caused last month’s shutdown (though Senators John McCain and Chris Coons have a bipartisan proposal on that). Advertisement Expect more give-and-take between the two sides of Congress: “I think everyone understands that this will probably end up being a Ping-Pong situation, and we’ll see where the ball lands,” said Representative Carlos Curbelo, Republican of Florida.

Comcast dropped out of the running for Fox once it became clear that Rupert Murdoch would prefer a tie-up with Disney, but it is studying whether to rejoin the fray, CNBC reported. More from Alex Sherman of CNBC: An unsolicited offer at a premium to Disney’s bid could persuade enough Fox shareholders to vote against Murdoch. His family controls 39 percent of Fox’s Class B voting shares but owns only 17 percent of all outstanding shares. Comcast executives suggested to Murdoch last year they would be willing to pay significantly more for Fox’s assets than what Disney was offering, said the people. Murdoch still went with the Disney offer, in large part due to regulatory concerns with Comcast.

technology,"By Thomas B. Edsall Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality. We may never stop arguing about which historic currents swept President Trump into the White House. Klaus Schwab, chairman of the World Economic Forum, is unlikely to have had Trump in mind when he described the fourth industrial revolution in Davos in January 2016: We stand on the brink of a technological revolution that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work, and relate to one another. In its scale, scope, and complexity, the transformation will be unlike anything humankind has experienced before. Compared with previous industrial revolutions, Schwab continued, the fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance. First Schwab looked at the bright side: The possibilities of billions of people connected by mobile devices, with unprecedented processing power, storage capacity, and access to knowledge, are unlimited. And these possibilities will be multiplied by emerging technology breakthroughs in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing. Schwab then turned his attention to the downside. Many “workers are disillusioned and fearful that their own real incomes and those of their children will continue to stagnate,” he said, and the “middle classes around the world are increasingly experiencing a pervasive sense of dissatisfaction and unfairness.” We tend to think of immigration — now fracturing parties of the left and right both here and in Europe — as distinct from technological innovation, but the two issues are intertwined on many levels, even down to the fact that most unauthorized immigrants are people who fly here and overstay their visas, not those who cross rural borders on foot. And air travel is the least of it. In an August 2015 Times story, “A 21st-Century Migrant’s Essentials: Food, Shelter, Smartphone,” Matthew Brunwasser described the situation that obtains now: In this modern migration, smartphone maps, global positioning apps, social media and WhatsApp have become essential tools. Migrants depend on them to post real-time updates about routes, arrests, border guard movements and transport, as well as places to stay and prices, all the while keeping in touch with family and friends. Long before this, Douglas Massey, a sociologist at Princeton, described the link between immigration and technology in a 2003 paper, “Patterns and Processes of International Migration in the 21st Century”: The same processes of economic globalization that create mobile populations in developing regions, and which generate a demand for their services in global cities, also create links of transportation, communication, as well as politics and culture, to make the international movement of people cheaper, quicker, and easier. There are innumerable social and economic pluses and minuses. In politics, however, the emphasis has often been on the negative. “The IT revolution improved living standards and its great technical achievements enjoy a high level of consumer and political support,” Mordecai Kurz, an economist at Stanford, wrote in a June 2017 paper. “However these sources of social benefits are also the cause of social losses and rising inequality that threaten the foundation of democratic society.” Schwab, a year earlier, had put it this way: There is an “inexorable shift from simple digitization (the Third Industrial Revolution) to innovation based on combinations of technologies (the Fourth Industrial Revolution).” With remarkable understatement, Schwab laid out the possible adverse consequences: As automation substitutes for labor across the entire economy, the net displacement of workers by machines might exacerbate the gap between returns to capital and returns to labor. Just to give a sense of the exponential nature of the rate of technological change, here’s how Sergey Brin described it in this year’s “Founders’ Letter,” which was released earlier this week: The Pentium IIs we used in the first year of Google performed about 100 million floating point operations per second. The GPUs we use today perform about 20 trillion such operations — a factor of about 200,000 difference — and our very own TPUs are now capable of 180 trillion (180,000,000,000,000) floating point operations per second. In point of fact, the use of robots — and of other methods of replacing workers with machines — has been growing in every advanced economy, particularly in Europe. According to the International Federation of Robotics, “By regions, the average robot density per 10,000 employees in Europe is 99 units, in the Americas 84 and in Asia 63 units.” In a March 2018 paper, “We Were The Robots: Automation in Manufacturing and Voting Behavior in Western Europe,” Massimo Anelli, Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig, of Bocconi University in Milan, found that “robot shock increases support for nationalist and radical right parties.” The authors note that “both technology and trade seem to drive structural changes which are consequential for voting behavior.” “Job losses in manufacturing due to automation do create fertile territory for continued populist appeal,” Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., said by email: In fact, some of the places where Trump made the biggest gains relative to McCain or Romney are in the heartland of heavy manufacturing where robots did lead to losses of manufacturing jobs. Hostile voter reaction to automation, according to three scholars at the Oxford Martin School at Oxford University — Carl Benedikt Frey, Thor Berger and Chinchih Chen — was crucial to Trump’s victory. In their October 2017 paper, “Political Machinery: Did Robots Swing the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election?” the authors demonstrate that Support for Donald Trump was significantly higher in local labor markets more exposed to the adoption of robots. Other things equal, a counterfactual analysis shows that Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania would have swung in favor of the Hillary Clinton if robot adoption had been two percent lower over the investigated period, leaving the Democrats with a majority in the Electoral College. Along similar lines, Frank Levy, also an economist at M.I.T., wrote in a December 2017 paper: AI (artificial intelligence) is helping to slowly polarize the occupational structure as it both creates high wage work and displaces men and women from certain blue collar and clerical (‘mid-skilled’) jobs into lower wage work. The result is similar to the displacement caused by manufactured imports and off-shored services. In his paper, “Computers and Populism: Artificial Intelligence, Jobs and Politics in the Near Term,” Levy writes: On balance, near-term AI will have the greatest effect on blue collar work, clerical work and other mid-skilled occupations. Given globalization’s effect on the 2016 presidential election, it is worth noting that near-term AI and globalization replace many of the same jobs. Take the case of truck drivers. Driverless trucks are already in use abroad in ports and mines, and, according to Levy, “there should be a sizable number of fully automated U.S. port facilities, mines and other industrial facilities” by 2024. With these developments, he estimated, there will be 76,000 fewer truck driving jobs in 2024 than the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently projects. Surveying the trucking industry recently in “The Future of Work: Robots, AI, and Automation,” Darrell West, a scholar at Brookings, warns that full adoption of driverless vehicles “would put at least 2.5 million drivers out of work.” Assessing the full range of employment, West observes that Robots, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, machine learning, drones and the Internet of Things are moving ahead rapidly and transforming the way businesses operate and how people earn their livelihoods. For millions who work in occupations like food service, retail sales and truck driving, machines are replacing their jobs. Levy argues that if the use of industrial robots on assembly and production lines continues to grow at the current pace, the stock of robots in the U.S. would be 105,000 higher in 2024 than in 2014. If I conservatively assume that each robot replaces two assemblers and fabricators, the 105,000 additional robots would result in 210,000 fewer assembler and fabricator jobs in 2024 than otherwise would have been the case. Where do these displaced workers look for a way to make a living? Levy’s answer is: farther down the ladder: AI’s near-term effect will not be mass unemployment but occupational polarization resulting in a slowly growing number of persons moving from mid-skilled jobs into lower wage work into such fields as food preparation and serving, building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and personal care and services. For many men, moving from the manufacturing or comparable job he took pride in to a job in a fast-food operation or in caring for the elderly is tough to swallow. (Not to mention the dislocating effects of the technological innovations in contraception that helped usher in the women’s and reproductive rights movements.) Levy points out that the cuts resulting from A.I. and automation in middle skill employment will be relatively modest in the short term, but the cuts will resonate far beyond their limited numbers: Job losses will appear as accelerating trends. Over time, trucks driving in dedicated lanes will appear on the roads and in multiple news stories. Increased numbers of people will be working side-by-side with robots. When a media story describes an AI-induced layoff in occupation, other persons in that occupation will assume they are also at risk. These developments will occur against a backdrop of monopoly-like firms like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook. What is the political significance of the A.I.-driven changes in the work force? They are the grist for the populist mill. Levy writes: A populist politician who campaigned on AI-induced job loss would start with ready-made definitions of the ""people” and the “elite” based on national fault lines that were sharpened in the 2016 presidential election. This politician also would have a ready-made example of disrespect: the set of highly educated coastal “elites” who make a very good living developing robots to put “the people” out of work. While Levy looks at the issue from the vantage point of those harmed by A.I., robotics and information technology, Kurz, the Stanford economist, examines the economic winners. In a recent essay for Project Syndicate, he writes: IT-driven automation proceeded at the same time that corporate market power was rising. Because technological improvements are the crucial engine of rising productivity and growth, IT advances are universally viewed as economically beneficial. The favorable view, according to Kurz, masks the dark side: by enabling and supporting the rise of corporate monopoly power, IT innovations have caused the rise in inequality and contributed to the slowdown in wage growth. While operating legally — indeed with the full support of the legal system — contemporary corporate technology leaders, including Brin, Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs (who died in 2011) and Mark Zuckerberg, accumulated unprecedented amounts of wealth. According to Kurz: Once an IT monopoly is established, it endows the company with the advantage of first mover. A combination of associated factors — additional patents, intellectual-property rights, trade secrets, falling computing and storage costs, and decreasing network user costs — then enable the company to consolidate market power, raise barriers to competition, and make it virtually impossible for potential competitors to break its power. IT networks endow a market leader with economies of scale that allow it to grow rapidly. Using their market power, such firms choke off innovations that threaten their position, often by purchasing competing firms. According to Kurz, the concentration of economic power, and with it political power, in the major technology companies has dangerous consequences: Monopoly profits have risen dramatically in the last three decades, from near zero in the early 1980s to $2.1 trillion — equivalent to 23 percent of total US corporate income — in 2015. During the same period, monopoly power caused the combined shares of wages and interest paid to capital to decline by 23 percentage points. The result is a cascading effect caused both by fueling the rise of corporate monopoly power and also by undermining the position of labor. It has altered the balance of market power in favor of corporations and against their customers, workers, and suppliers. And it has had a profoundly negative impact on lower-skill workers, in particular. Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, pointed out in a December 2017 paper, “Should We Be Reassured If Automation in the Future Looks Like Automation in the Past?” that The history of automation — and how the U.S. economy has handled it over the last several decades — suggests that even if AI is similar to previous waves of automation, that should not be entirely comforting since technological advances in recent decades have brought tremendous benefits but have also contributed to increasing inequality and falling labor force participation. Furman rejects the argument that automation will lead to the permanent elimination of jobs: The concern is not that robots will take human jobs and render humans unemployable. The traditional economic arguments against that are borne out by centuries of experience. Instead, Furman contends that the problem lies in “the process of turnover,” which “could lead to sustained periods of time with a large fraction of people not working.” In the short run, not all workers will have the training or ability to find the new jobs created by AI. Moreover, this “short run” could last for decades and, in fact, the economy could be in a series of “short runs” for even longer. A short run that lasts for decades — or a series of short runs that last even longer — would seem to warrant grave alarm. While much of the focus on job losses resulting from robotization and trade has been on men, a January 2018 study led by Saadia Zahidi, head of Education, Gender and Work, at the World Economic Forum, found that “among the workers affected by labor market disruptions, under both models, a larger share — 57 percent — are projected to be female.” A separate study of the potential consequences of automation in England, “Managing automation: Employment, inequality and ethics in the digital age,” written by Carys Roberts, Mathew Lawrence and Loren King, researchers at the Institute for Public Policy Research, found that Of all the jobs in the UK, a greater proportion of those held by women compared to men are likely to be technically automatable, and women make up a smaller proportion of people in high-skill occupations that are resilient to automation or complemented by technology. Among liberal-leaning economists and public policy experts, there is a loose consensus on what should be done to manage the adverse consequences of both automation and trade. Furman lists some initiatives: expanding education and training so more people have skills that complement and benefit from innovations, increasing the progressivity of the tax system to make sure that everyone shares in the overall benefits of the economy, and expanding institutional support for higher wages, including a higher minimum wage and stronger collective bargaining and other forms of worker voice. Other related proposals include a major increase in the earned-income tax credit, a focus on job-specific training at community colleges, portable pensions, liberalization of occupational licensing and, more controversially, the creation of a universal basic income. These proposals — some underwhelming or undoable — find strong support among Democratic elected officials. Still, opposition from Republicans is adamant — not only do they oppose increased domestic spending, but it appears to be in the political interests of the party to exacerbate the negative consequences of automation and free trade. David Autor, an economist at M.I.T., examined the political consequences in congressional districts hurt by increased trade with China and found a significant increase in the election of very conservative Republicans. Using the same techniques to examine the 2016 election, Autor calculated that if the post-2000 increase in China trade had been half as large as it in fact was, Hillary Clinton would have won majorities in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. That would have been enough to make her the victor in the Electoral College, as the accompanying graphic shows. There is also a dose effect. Expanding on Autor’s work, Andrea Cerrato and Francesco Ruggieri, of the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, and Federico Maria Ferrara, of the University of Geneva, wrote in their March 2018 paper, “Why Does Import Competition Favor Republicans? Localized Trade Shocks, Voting Behavior, and Scapegoating in the U.S.”: Rather than directly opposing free trade policies, individuals in import-exposed communities tend to target scapegoats such as immigrants and minorities. This drives support for right-wing candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups. The authors conclude that in areas affected by trade, the scapegoating of immigrants “takes place across the board and is not limited to manufacturing workers.” In other words, job losses and plant closings are a political gold mine for the Republican Party, crucial to their victories in House and presidential races and almost certainly in Senate, gubernatorial and state legislative races as well. In highly polarized times, when partisans view victory by the opposition as a threat to the nation, Republicans will easily find ways to rationalize continued economic deterioration and the ongoing demonization of immigrants and minorities. They’ve had a lot of practice and they have effectively boxed themselves into a scapegoat strategy that capitalizes on — instead of improving — the suffering of many of their most loyal supporters. The hard core of Trump’s voters — more than half of all Republican voters don’t just approve of him, but strongly approve — have, in turn, demonstrated a willingness to deify the president no matter what he does or says — a deification dependent in no small part on Trump’s adoption of new communications technologies like Twitter. The determination of the Trump wing of the Republican Party to profiteer on technologically driven economic and cultural upheaval — and the success of this strategy to date — suggests that the party will continue on its path. For this reason and many others, it is critically important that Democrats develop a more far-reaching understanding of the disruptive, technologically fueled economic and cultural forces that are now shaping American politics — if they intend to steer the country in a more constructive direction, that is.

technology,"By Kenneth Chang (Sign up for the Science Times newsletter and sync your calendar with the solar system.) KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. — From the same pad where NASA launched rockets that carried astronauts to the moon, a big, new American rocket arced into space on Tuesday. But this time, NASA was not involved. The rocket, the Falcon Heavy, was built by SpaceX, the company founded and run by the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. “It seems surreal to me,” Mr. Musk said during a news conference after the launch. The launch of this turbocharged version of the workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which has been carrying cargo to space for years, marks an important milestone in spaceflight, the first time a rocket this powerful has been sent into space by a private company rather than a government space agency. The rocket carried a playful payload: Mr. Musk’s red Roadster, an electric sports car built by his other company, Tesla. Strapped inside the car is a mannequin wearing one of SpaceX’s spacesuits. They are expected to orbit the sun for hundreds of millions of years. “It’s kind of silly and fun, but silly and fun things are important,” Mr. Musk said. The success gives SpaceX momentum to begin developing even larger rockets, which could help fulfill Mr. Musk’s dream of sending people to Mars. To do that, he has described a new-generation rocket called B.F.R. (the B stands for big; the R for rocket) that might be ready to launch in the mid-2020s. The near-flawless performance of the Heavy on Tuesday “gives me a lot of confidence we can make the B.F.R. design work,” Mr. Musk said. He added that he hoped the launch would encourage other companies and other countries to aim for more ambitious goals in space. “We want a new space race,” he said. “Races are exciting.” Mr. Musk’s visions include humans living both on Earth and Mars. He’s part of a new generation of entrepreneurial space pioneers that includes Jeffrey P. Bezos, the founder of Amazon, who has said one of the goals driving his rocket company, Blue Origin, is the prospect of millions of people living in space. Planetary Resources, an American company with a large investment from Luxembourg, hopes to mine asteroids for profit. Moon Express, based in Florida, sees a business in providing regular transportation to and from the moon. For now, the Heavy will enable SpaceX to compete for contracts to launch larger spy satellites, and some experts in spaceflight are encouraging NASA to use private rockets like the Heavy instead of the gigantic and more expensive rocket, the Space Launch System, that is currently being developed in part to take astronauts back to the moon. “It basically gives them another tool in their toolbox for accomplishing the space community’s goals,” said Phil Larson, an assistant dean at the University of Colorado’s engineering school who previously worked as a senior manager of communications and corporate projects at SpaceX. SpaceX successfully launched its newest rocket, the Falcon Heavy, on Tuesday. Although delayed by high-altitude winds, the countdown proceeded smoothly, without any of the glitches that have bedeviled other maiden launches of new rockets. The Heavy roared to life, a plume of smoke and steam shooting sideways from the launchpad. It rose from the pad, with an impossibly bright glare of 27 engines beneath it. About 15 seconds later, a thunderous roar, traveling at the speed of sound, rolled over the spectators. Just over three minutes after it blasted off, the most suspenseful part of the flight was over, as the boosters dropped off and the second stage continued into Earth orbit. Some eight minutes after launch, a pair of sonic booms rocked the area as the two side boosters set down in near synchrony on two landing pads at Cape Canaveral. In the past few years, SpaceX has figured out how to routinely bring a booster stage back in one piece to fly again on future flights. The one blemish on the mission was that the center booster, which was to set down on a floating platform in the Atlantic, slammed into the water instead, because some of the engines failed to ignite for the final landing burn. Once in orbit, the rocket sent back video of the spacesuit-wearing mannequin in the car, with a hand on the steering wheel. On the dashboard were the words “Don’t Panic,” a nod to Douglas Adams’s book “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.” The spacecraft journeyed through Earth’s Van Allen radiation belt. About seven hours after the rocket took off, Mr. Musk announced that a third and final burn had put his sports car on an elliptical orbit away from Earth and around the sun that extends beyond Mars’s orbit. Since 2010, the company has been sending the smaller Falcon 9 rocket into orbit, deploying satellites and carrying cargo to crews aboard the International Space Station. The company has disrupted the global launch business with its lower prices and reusable boosters. The Falcon Heavy is capable of lifting 140,000 pounds to low-Earth orbit, more than any other rocket today. Because all three boosters are to be recovered to fly again, a Falcon Heavy launch costs not much more than one by the company’s existing rocket, Mr. Musk said. SpaceX lists a price of $90 million for a Falcon Heavy flight, compared with $62 million for one by Falcon 9, a bargain in the context of spaceflight. Mr. Musk estimated that his company had spent more than half a billion dollars on Falcon Heavy and said that the program was almost canceled three times. SpaceX has booked coming Heavy flights for Arabsat, a Saudi Arabian communications company, and the United States Air Force. However, the market for the Heavy is smaller than what Mr. Musk envisioned when he announced development of the rocket in 2011. Back then, he expected that SpaceX’s launches would be evenly split between Falcon 9s and Heavies. But the development of the Heavy took years longer than anticipated — the central booster had to be redesigned to withstand the stresses of the powerful side boosters — and with advances in miniaturization, the trend is toward smaller satellites. SpaceX also boosted the capability of the Falcon 9, which now can launch many of the payloads that would have originally required a Heavy. In addition to its central booster, the Falcon Heavy was equipped with two additional side boosters that essentially tripled its power at liftoff. While the Heavy uses many of the same components as the Falcon 9, Mr. Musk had cautioned that failures during a test flight would not be surprising. In particular, he worried about complex buffeting of air flowing past the boosters, which is difficult to predict even with the most sophisticated computer simulations. The success of the Heavy could quell criticism that followed SpaceX’s first launch of the year — a Falcon 9 rocket that carried a highly classified payload code-named “Zuma,” on Jan. 7. A day after the launch, there were reports that Zuma had fallen back to Earth. SpaceX officials vociferously asserted that the Falcon 9 performed as expected, suggesting that blame for anything that went wrong should fall on Northrop Grumman, which built Zuma. In the past year, SpaceX has tabled many of the plans for future development of the Heavy. The company had intended to use the rocket to launch one of SpaceX’s capsules, known as the Dragon, without people, on a mission to land on Mars. That was scrapped last summer. Last year, Mr. Musk also said two space tourists would be launched by a Falcon Heavy on an around-the-moon trip this year. On Monday, he said that for now the company had no immediate plans to make the improvements needed before putting people aboard. Instead, SpaceX is focusing its efforts on the B.F.R. It would be a two-stage rocket: a powerful booster to provide lift out of Earth’s gravity and then a spaceship on top for interplanetary missions. The full vehicle would not be ready until the 2020s, but Mr. Musk said he had “aspirational” hopes to begin short hopper tests of the spaceship portion next year.

technology,"by Noel Murray April 3, 2018UPDATED April 19, 2018  Welcome to Watching, The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site. Sign up for our thrice-weekly newsletter, here.  Every month, Netflix Australia adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for April, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes its schedule without giving notice. (Unfortunately, the streaming information provided in our Watchlist listings only applies to viewers in the United States.)  Prefer to go out? Check out our Australian cinema guide for April.  As gripping as it is grim, this 10-part TV adaptation of the best-selling historical novel by Caleb Carr stars Daniel Brühl as a progressive 1890s psychologist who works with a troubled newspaper illustrator (played by Luke Evans) and a feminist police secretary (Dakota Fanning) to track a serial killer preying on boy prostitutes. Upscale production values elevate a sordid, pulpy plot, helping “The Alienist” deliver both an involving mystery and a detailed portrait of a rapidly changing America.—  One of the best of the recent wave of sophisticated, artful British crime series, “Broadchurch” reaches its conclusion with Season 3, in which Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) and Detective Inspector Alec Hardy (David Tennant) once again confront both the larger cruelty of the world and the smaller dissatisfactions of their own personal lives. In this final eight-episode run, a rape investigation tears apart their working-class coastal town, dredging up old secrets and unabsolved sins.—  Also of interest: “Z Nation” Season 3 (April 5), “Charité’ Season 1 (April 19), “Happy!” Season 1 (April 26) and “Superstition” Season 1 (April 29).—  TV’s prettiest-looking cooking series gets its second spinoff, focused on four of the world’s most acclaimed dessert-makers: the Milk Bar’s Christina Tosi, Room 4’s Will Goldfarb, El Celler de Can Roca’s Jordi Roca and Caffè Sicilia’s Corrado Assenza. As always, expect the director-producer David Gelb and his crew to combine these chefs’ philosophical rumination on food with drool-worthy images of colorful sweets.—  Although it only ran for three seasons in the 1960s, the family-friendly science-fiction series “Lost in Space” has maintained a steady presence in popular culture, thanks largely to its memorable characters and endearingly wonky science. Netflix’s new remake appears to be keeping most of what worked the first time out, albeit with updated special effects, and a more modern outlook on gender roles. The comically dour Dr. Smith, for example — indelibly played by Jonathan Harris in the original — is a woman in this version, and she’s played by a cleverly cast Parker Posey.—  President John F. Kennedy’s life, career and death have been covered extensively in documentaries, movie dramas, and TV mini-series, much more than his brother Robert’s political career and assassination. The four-hour docu-series “Bobby Kennedy for President” is an effort to correct that imbalance, using the landmark cultural moment of Kennedy’s 1968 White House run — and its abrupt, tragic end — as a lens through which to observe what he stood for and what he meant to a generation of young idealists.—  Also of interest: “The Boss Baby: Back in Business” Season 1 (April 6), “Troy: Fall of a City’ Season 1 (April 6), “The Magic School Bus Rides Again” Season 2 (April 13), “Four Seasons in Havana” Season 1 (April 15), “The Chalet” Season 1 (April 17), “Dope” Season 2 (April 20).—  Perched between 1970s counterculture slackness and 1980s blockbuster bombast, the action-musical “The Blues Brothers” stars John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, expanding the mythology of their R&B-loving “Saturday Night Live” characters, Jake and Elwood Blues. As the brothers reunite their old band — in order to raise money to save a Catholic orphanage — they’re pursued by various law-enforcement agencies and fringe groups. Car chases and crashes ensue, in a movie with an unusually deadpan sense of humor that gets most of its energy from performances by soul legends like Cab Calloway, James Brown, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin.—  Director Yorgos Lanthimos’s surreal science-fiction comedy “The Lobster” stars Colin Farrell as a sad-sack single man, in a society where adults are required to be romantically coupled. Given one last chance at love — before being turned into animal, as the law demands — the hero first becomes increasingly desperate, and then strangely drawn to a woman (played by Rachel Weisz) in a secret outsider society of rebels. Unpredictable from start to finish, “The Lobster” is a barbed satire, poking at our social conventions.—  No modern filmmaker has been as adept as director Christopher Nolan at turning personal obsessions into international box-office sensations. “Interstellar” is one of his most straightforward, crowd-pleasing pictures, starring Matthew McConaughey as a NASA pilot who takes part in a last-ditch mission to save humanity by exploring a wormhole. Yet even this film is unapologetically brainy, filled with speculative science and philosophical debates about human nature. As always, Nolan finds ways to make the cerebral viscerally exciting.—  The second film from producer J.J. Abrams’s science-fiction-horror franchise “Cloverfield” (and, so far, the best), “10 Cloverfield Lane” stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a woman held captive by two men, played by John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr., who claim they’re keeping her safe from a massive global attack. The heroine tries to figure out the real truth at the same time the audience does, in a tense, twisty movie that — like the other entries in this series — looks at a possibly world-ending catastrophe from a narrower, human perspective.—  Released at a time when seemingly every action movie was trying (and failing), to copy “Die Hard,” this 1994 thriller offered a winning variation on the “capable loner outsmarts the genius terrorist” formula, adding humor and a strong hook. Dennis Hopper plays a madman who rigs a Los Angeles city bus with a bomb that will explode if the vehicle drops below 50 miles per hour. Keanu Reeves plays a cop who partners with a plucky passenger (played by Sandra Bullock) to keep everyone onboard from blowing up. With its unpretentious direction by Jan de Bont and a taut script by Graham Yost, “Speed” remains a prime example of how to turn a simple premise into something awesome.—  Before he directed Pixar’s massive hits “The Incredibles” and “Ratatouille,” Brad Bird directed this heartfelt, heartbreaking animated adaptation of the children’s book by Ted Hughes. Although it flopped in theaters, “The Iron Giant” has since become a cult favorite. A thrilling story about a boy who befriends an towering alien robot, the movie is a mediation on what it means to be hero, and it is also a catalogue of Bird’s pop-culture obsessions — from old Superman cartoons to pulp magazines.—  Also of Interest  “Baby Mama” (April 1), “The Bourne Identity” (April 1), “The Bourne Legacy” (April 1), “The Bourne Supremacy” (April 1), “The Bourne Ultimatum” (April 1), “Elizabeth” (April 1), “Funny Girl” (April 1), “Knocked Up” (April 1), “The Meddler” (April 1), “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” (April 15), “Monty Python: Live at the Hollywood Bowl” (April 15), “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” (April 15) and “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief” (April 30).—  The accomplished young comic actors Abbi Jacobson and Dave Franco play against type in the writer-director Marja-Lewis Ryan’s “6 Balloons,” an edgy drama about the stress of dealing with a loved one who’s hooked on drugs. Franco is a heroin addict suffering through a relapse and Jacobson is the hyper-organized, straight-laced sister who spends one long, tense day trying to get him the help he needs while also making sure that his life isn’t totally upended — two goals that aren’t necessarily compatible.—  Chiwetel Ejiofor gives one of the best performances of his long, accomplished career in “Come Sunday,” playing the real-life evangelical minister Carlton Pearson, who in the early 2000s began preaching “the Gospel of Inclusion,” arguing that Jesus Christ has saved everyone regardless of a person’s religious beliefs. Directed by Joshua Marston and written by Marcus Hinchey, the film is intended as a bracing challenge to fervent Christian believers, asking them to consider the true purpose of their faith.—  In 1960, not long after NASA publicly announced the names of the seven pilots who became the first American men in space, a private organization started recruiting women to undergo some of the same psychological and physical tests administered to the so-called Mercury Seven. The purpose: to see if the challenges of flying beyond Earth’s atmosphere differed by gender. The documentary “Mercury 13” is a look into this lesser-known project, considering the way the codified sexism of the post-World War II era denied a one-of-a-kind opportunity to some would-be (and perfectly capable) adventurers .—  For the most part, the movies that Adam Sandler has delivered to Netflix as part of his recent four-picture deal have been embarrassingly broad. But there’s reason to hope that this last film in the batch will be the best — in part because it is directed by the incisive veteran comic Robert Smigel (who also wrote the film with Sandler), and in part because it also stars Sandler’s old “Saturday Night Live” castmate Chris Rock. Sandler and Rock play parents who spend an anxious seven days leading up to their kids’ wedding. Rachel Dratch and Steve Buscemi also star, in a film that could potentially hearken to more emotionally complex Sandler projects like “The Wedding Singer.”  Also of interest: “Amateur” (April 6), “The 4th Company” (April 6), “Orbiter 9” (April 6), “Pickpockets” (April 12), “Dude” (April 20), “Psychokinesis” (April 25) and “Candy Jar” (April 27).

technology,"By Kenneth Chang On Sunday, SpaceX launched its first rocket of the year. During the company’s webcast of the liftoff, everything seemed to go without a hitch. The second stage of the rocket headed toward orbit as the booster returned to land at Cape Canaveral. But on Monday, word started spreading that something went very wrong with this highly classified mission, code-named “Zuma.” Northrop Grumman Corporation built the satellite, and the customer was the United States government. But beyond that, we don’t know much. Zuma is presumed to be some sort of spy satellite. We don’t even know which federal agency hired Northrop Grumman to build it. The launch was originally scheduled for November, but was postponed for additional analysis of the nose cone that protects the payload during its passage through the atmosphere. During the webcast, the SpaceX commentator indicated that the nose cone was jettisoned properly. Neither SpaceX nor Northrop Grumman nor anyone else confirmed successful deployment of Zuma. On Monday, Peter B. de Selding, editor of SpaceIntelReport wrote on Twitter: Ars Technica, Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal followed with stories that reported that the satellite had been lost. The Verge examined what was and was not known. Zuma apparently never separated from the second stage and plunged back to Earth. Not necessarily. According to an article in Wired last November, Northrop Grumman not only built Zuma but also provided the part that connected the satellite to the rocket known as the payload adapter. For most launches, SpaceX provides the payload adapter. On Tuesday morning, SpaceX released a statement from Gwynne Shotwell, the company president, which emphatically stated that the company saw nothing that indicated SpaceX was at fault: For clarity: after review of all data to date, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on Sunday night. If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately. Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible. Northrop Grumman has publicly said only, “This is a classified mission. We cannot comment on classified missions.” “I can’t conclude anything definitely,” said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics who avidly tracks the comings and goings of space objects. “We’re going on rumors and conflicting statements.” Dr. McDowell notes that the satellite appears to have made it to orbit — an entry for Zuma appears at Space-Track.org, a database of objects in orbit. In addition, two hours, 15 minutes after launch, observers reported seeing something over East Africa that appeared to be the second stage of the Falcon 9 just before it dropped out of orbit. (Second stages of rockets are typically steered downward to burn up in the atmosphere so that they do not add to the junk circling Earth.) “Which is about the right time for a de-orbit,” Dr. McDowell said. But if Zuma had never separated from the second stage, it would have been also dragged to its demise. SpaceX and Zuma’s operators likely knew that the satellite was still attached to the rocket’s second stage, which would raise the question of why they did not delay the de-orbit and try to fix the problem. Perhaps there was no way to override the preprogrammed de-orbit burn, Dr. McDowell said. Or the rocket did not pass over enough radio dishes for a new command to be sent. Alternatively, the malfunction may have damaged the communications hardware. Dr. McDowell said it would be a week before the projected orbit of Zuma would pass over amateur satellite watchers. SpaceX has suffered two Falcon 9 failures. During a launch for NASA of cargo headed to the International Space Station in 2015, a strut within the second stage snapped, leading to the destruction of the rocket after it blasted off. Fifteen months later, during fueling for an engine test at the launchpad, a failure within a liquid oxygen tank led to an explosion and loss of a $200 million satellite. The company recovered with 18 successful launches in 2017. In the early years of SpaceX, the first three launches of its much smaller Falcon 1 rocket failed. Until now, SpaceX has not had a situation where a satellite reached orbit but failed to separate from the rocket. Ms. Shotwell says no. In her Tuesday statement, she said: Since the data reviewed so far indicates that no design, operational or other changes are needed, we do not anticipate any impact on the upcoming launch schedule. Falcon Heavy has been rolled out to launchpad LC-39A for a static fire later this week, to be followed shortly thereafter by its maiden flight. We are also preparing for an F9 launch for SES and the Luxembourg Government from SLC-40 in three weeks. Good question.

technology,"By Reuters (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Tuesday reported resilient iPhone sales in the face of waning global demand and promised $100 billion in additional stock buybacks, reassuring investors that its decade-old smartphone invention had life in it yet. Apple's quarterly results topped Wall Street forecasts, which dropped ahead of the report on growing concern over the iPhone. The Cupertino, California-based company also was more optimistic about the current quarter than most financial analysts, driving shares up 3.6 percent to $175.25 after hours. Suppliers around the globe had warned of smartphone weakness, playing into fears that the company known for popularizing personal computers, tablets and smartphones had become too reliant on the iPhone.  Sales of 52.2 million iPhones against a Wall Street target of 52.3 million was a comfort and up from 50.7 million last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Apple bought $23.5 billion of stock in the March quarter, and said it planned to hike its dividend 16 percent, compared with a 10.5 percent increase last year. Analysts believe the heavy emphasis on buybacks will bolster share prices, but some investors wished Apple had found different uses for the cash.  ""I'd hoped for more on the dividend side or maybe a strategic investment,"" said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel. ""I assume Apple can't find a strategic investment at the current prices that will move the needle for them. The $100 billion buyback is good for right now but it's not exactly looking to the future."" The cash Apple earmarked for stock buybacks is about twice the $50 billion market capitalization of electric car maker Tesla Inc. Apple posted revenue for its March quarter of $61.1 billion, up from $52.9 billion last year. Wall Street expected $60.8 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Average selling prices for iPhones were $728, compared with Wall Street expectations of $742. The figure is up more than 10 percent from $655 a year ago, suggesting Apple's iPhone X, which starts at $999, has helped boost prices. Analysts had feared the high price was muting demand for the iPhone X, but Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was the most popular iPhone model every week in the March quarter. ""This is the first cycle that we've ever had where the top of the line iPhone model has also been the most popular,"" Cook said during the company's earnings call.  ""It's one of those things like when a team wins the Super Bowl, maybe you want them to win by a few more points. But it's a Super Bowl winner and that's how we feel about it."" The iPhone X has shaped up to be ""a good, not a great product. There was a time prior to its introduction that investors expected it to be a great product,"" said Thomas Forte, an analyst with D.A. Davidson Companies.  ""Now that we know it is a good product, as investors have lowered expectations, that is enough, in my view, for shares to go higher from current levels."" Positive iPhone news boosted shares of chip suppliers. Skyworks Solutions Inc rose 2.9 percent, Broadcom Inc was up 2 percent, while Cirrus Logic gained 4.3 percent. Apple also predicted revenue of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion in the June quarter, ahead of the $51.6 billion Wall Street expected as of Monday evening, and the share repurchases in the March quarter drove Apple's cash net of debt down slightly to $145 billion.  ""We are returning the cash to investors as we have promised,"" Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview. Profits were $2.73 per share versus expectations of $2.68 per share, as of Monday, and up from $2.10 a year ago. Apple's services business, which includes Apple Music, the App Store and iCloud, posted $9.1 billion in revenue compared with expectations of $8.3 billion. Heading into earnings, investors were hopeful that growth in that segment could help offset the cooling global smartphone market. Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester, said Apple's services segment results were positive but warned that Apple needed to continue to boost subscriptions on its platforms, which reached 270 million users in the March quarter and includes people who subscribe to third-party apps on the iPhone as well as Apple's own services like iCloud. ""Apps are carrying most (services revenue) right now, but Apple needs to get to a place where it's mostly subscriptions and monthly fees and not just one-off downloads,"" Ask said. Apple traditionally updates its share buyback and dividend program each spring, and the $100 billion it added this year compares with an increase of $50 billion last year. (Graphic: Apple Buys Back Shares - https://reut.rs/2JIjkgo) In February, Apple said it planned to draw down its excess cash, although Cook had downplayed the possibility of a special dividend. But investors have had concerns around Apple because of brewing trade tensions with China. Greater China sales rose 21 percent from a year earlier, Apple's best growth rate there in 10 quarters, to $13.0 billion. While there has not yet been a tariff on devices such as Apple's iPhone, Cook traveled last week to Washington to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss trade matters.  ""China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins,"" Cook said on the call, when asked about a possible trade war. ""I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently,"" he said.  Apple has been emphasizing its contributions to the U.S. economy in recent months, outlining a $30 billion U.S. spending plan and highlighting the tens of billions of dollars it spends each year with U.S.-based suppliers. In recent months, Apple has been emphasizing the size of its overall user base, which includes used iPhones, rather than focusing strictly on new device sales, a sign of the increasing importance of making money off users without selling them new hardware.

technology,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin FEB. 21, 2018
 Good Wednesday. Here’s what we’re watching: • What it takes to be a whistle-blower. • Broadcom whacks Qualcomm for raising its NXP bid. • Untangling the productivity mystery. • How Skadden got involved in the special counsel’s Russia inquiry. Want this in your own email inbox? Here’s the sign-up. Sigmund Freud is reputed to have said that “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.” The Supreme Court took that approach in deciding what is required to qualify for protection from retaliation as a whistle-blower. A provision in the Dodd-Frank Act defines a “whistle-blower” as someone who provides “information relating to a violation of the securities laws to the Commission.” That seems simple enough, but the Securities and Exchange Commission made something of a hash out of the requirement by taking an expansive view in a rule aimed at protecting an employee from retaliation even if the person only reports information internally. Advertisement In Digital Realty Trust v. Somers, a former employee of Digital Realty, Paul Somers, claimed he was terminated after he reported possible securities law violations to senior management. Although he never alerted anyone outside the company, Mr. Somers filed a lawsuit claiming his termination violated the anti-retaliation provision by relying on the S.E.C.’s rule. Advertisement The Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, rejected that reading of the statute. It applied a simple analysis: “Courts are not at liberty to dispense with the condition—tell the S.E.C.—Congress imposed.” By not reporting his suspicions to the S.E.C., he lost the protection afforded whistleblowers. One of the complaints expressed by companies when the S.E.C. considered the whistle-blower rules was that they did not require employees to report information to management first. The incentive created by the Digital Realty ruling is straightforward: Don’t just tell your boss about possible violations; make a beeline to the S.E.C.’s front door, at least if you want protection from retaliation. — Peter J. Henning The Dow Jones industrial average rose 139 points in the half-hour after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent policy meeting at 2 p.m. and was up more than 300 points on the day. Then the index sank 455 points in the final 90 minutes to close down 0.67 percent for the day. Why? There didn’t appear to be anything in the minutes to make investors particularly bearish or bullish. Perhaps the bond market was to blame for the plunge. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which rises as its price falls, kept climbing after the minutes came out, closing at 2.95 percent. Higher bond yields can make stocks look more expensive, prompting investors to sell. As a result, Wednesday’s mini move indicates that the tug of war between the stock and bond markets is still very much on. While we’re on the Fed minutes, it appears that the central bank’s policymakers did not spend much time discussing an indicator that is flashing a warning sign. The data point in question is the saving rate, which recently sank to a 12-year low. With the rate at 2.4 percent of disposable income, a big drop in the stock market, like the one that occurred earlier this month, could prompt consumers to cut their spending. The Fed’s policymakers did not appear overly worried about the saving rate at their last meeting, which was held before the market’s plunge. The minutes state: In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant consumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in household wealth would be sustained. — Peter Eavis Qualcomm defied Broadcom’s demand not to raise its takeover bid for NXP on Tuesday by increasing that offer by about 16 percent, to $127.50 a share from $110. Now Broadcom has retaliated. Broadcom shaved $3 per share off its hostile takeover bid for Qualcomm, to $79. Broadcom’s rationale is that the new NXP offer transfers value away from Qualcomm’s shareholders. From the news release: Broadcom believes that a responsible Qualcomm board could have preserved value by following ISS’s clear recommendation to work with Broadcom on the NXP transaction and negotiate the sale of Qualcomm to Broadcom. Instead Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders. Let’s take a look at the math Advertisement • Broadcom argues that Qualcomm gave up $4.10 a share, or $6.2 billion, in value to NXP shareholders. In response, it cut its price. At $79 a share, Broadcom’s current offer is just under 13 percent higher than its original offer. (Of course, other elements of Broadcom’s last bid — the $8 billion breakup fee for antitrust reasons, the ticking fee if a deal takes more than 12 months to close — still stand.) • Broadcom also contends privately that had Qualcomm agreed to start deal talks, the two of them could have held firm against NXP shareholders like Elliott Management and Soroban Capital Partners. By giving up less negotiating power to the holdout shareholders, the argument goes, Qualcomm could have recut the NXP deal at a far lower price. • Qualcomm argues privately that the $4.10 a share is nonsense, since the NXP deal a) wasn’t going to get done at $110 a share and b) will still add to its earnings per share price starting in the 2019 fiscal year. The bet on the shareholder meeting Broadcom had previously said that it would walk away if the NXP offer went above $110 a share, but now seems content to take its chances at Qualcomm’s annual shareholder meeting. Broadcom wants six seats on Qualcomm’s board. That campaign gained momentum when the proxy advisers I.S.S. and Glass Lewis recommended that Qualcomm shareholders vote for at least four of its director nominees. A Qualcomm representative didn’t have an immediate comment. How the shares moved today: Qualcomm’s were down 1.5 percent, while Broadcom’s were up slightly. Shares in NXP — the real winner in this deal saga so far — were essentially unchanged. — Michael de la Merced The deals flyaround • Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason pressed Xerox to pursue alternatives to its complicated deal with Fujifilm. (Reuters) • HNA has borrowed from the private equity firm Pacific Alliance Group, a sign that it may be struggling to raise capital from more traditional sources. (FT) 
            But might the return to full employment fuel a rebound?         FEB. 20, 2018
 An economy is doing well when companies each year manage to become more productive, or in other words, get more output from their employees and equipment. But productivity for years has grown far more slowly than it did in the past, effectively restraining economic growth. This decline has prompted economists to hunt for causes – and the latest big work on the issue comes from the McKinsey Global Institute. The Upshot’s Neil Irwin does a great job of explaining McKinsey’s main finding: The latest wrinkle is that the researchers now believe that productivity growth depends not just on the supply side of the economy — what companies produce and what technologies they use to do it — but also significantly on the demand side. That is to say, productivity advancements don’t happen in a vacuum just because technology is available. They also happen because companies need to increase production to match demand for their goods, and a shortage, either of workers or of materials, forces them to think creatively about how to do so. Little in economics is straightforward, however, and McKinsey’s deep dive prompted a couple of questions. Jaana Remes, one of the authors of the work, was kind enough to respond. Advertisement 1) In its report, McKinsey notes that the slow down in productivity growth was noticeable before the financial crisis. What caused that? And to what degree did those causes contribute to the decline in productivity growth after the financial crisis? This is important because these forces could continue to weigh on productivity. In the years leading up to 2008, the productivity improvements that started in the 1990s with the introduction of information technology were largely complete, Ms. Remes explains. Important new technologies can often take well over 10 years to have a big impact on productivity, she adds. The optimistic take, though, is that we can in the coming years expect to see big benefits as companies further automate, and introduce artificial intelligence. 2) If a sluggish economy can create the conditions for weak productivity, why did France, Spain and Italy, whose economies were anemic in the period under study, have significantly better productivity performances than faster-growing countries? First, the numbers: From 2010 to 2014, labor productivity grew by 1.4 percent a year in Spain and 1 percent in France, well in excess of the negative 0.2 percent rate for Britain and the United States. Why was that? Because Britain and the United States had made superior productivity gains before 2010. That made it harder for the two countries to notch similarly strong productivity growth in the years after the financial crisis. By contrast, France and Spain, which had made far fewer productivity gains before 2010, were able to eke out at least some afterward. Ms. Remes also points out that a big cause of Spain’s post-2010 gain came from a reduction in hours worked. That might be described as the least desirable way to bolster productivity because it implies a reduction in incomes for workers. The most economically beneficial type of productivity gain occurs when output per employee increases as hours worked grow. — Peter Eavis New research posted by France’s central bank, the Banque de France, shows that the largest companies in the United States now account for a significantly larger share of production. This dominance, the paper asserts, could allow the companies to enjoy “monopoly rents,” the term economists use to describe the subsidies companies enjoy if their business is protected in ways that are not available to other firms. “If these firms hold a dominant position in their market, they enjoy monopoly rents and have little incentive to invest in order to increase their productive capacities. This behavior could explain the weakness of investment in recent years, despite the high rates of return on capital.” David Wessel, writing for Harvard Business Review, also recently took a look at whether dominant companies are holding the economy back. — Peter Eavis The largest United States bank by assets announced that it plans to tear down its current headquarters at 270 Park Ave. and build 2.5 million square-foot modern tower in its place. Advertisement The new headquarters has yet to be designed, but it is expected, according to Bloomberg, to be between 70 and 75 stories and house 15,000 employees. The current headquarters was designed in the late 1950s for about 3,500 employees, JPMorgan said. During construction, employees will be temporarily moved 237, 245 and 277 Park Ave. and 383 and 390 Madison Ave., Bloomberg reported citing a person familiar with the matter. The tower would be the first major project under New York City’s Midtown East rezoning plan, designed to encourage office construction in the area. The job recruiting site said Wednesday that it has hired Jim Cox as its C.F.O., as part of a series of high-level executive appointments. Mr. Cox was most recently at Lithium Technologies, a maker of customer relationship management software. Here’s what Robert Hohman, Glassdoor’s C.E.O. and co-founder, said: “We are pleased to welcome Jim to Glassdoor as our new CFO as he brings a proven track record of building and managing financial operations and teams at high-growth technology companies.” Glassdoor also appointed Christian Sutherland-Wong, most recently its general manager of monetization, as its first chief operating officer, and Samantha Zupan, a longtime executive, as its vice president of global corporate communications. — Michael de la Merced The giant law firm’s work for the former Trump campaign manager — who has been charged with several criminal acts by Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian election interference — has come into question after a former Skadden associate entered a guilty plea in the investigation. Advertisement More from Kenneth Vogel and Andrew Kramer of the NYT: The interest from prosecutors in what Skadden did for the Ukrainian government is one indication of the wide-ranging nature of the inquiries related to Mr. Manafort. It also highlights the risks associated with advising authoritarian governments overseas, a lucrative sideline among Washington lawyers, lobbyists and public relations consultants. Skadden’s response: It fired the associate in question, Alex van der Zwaan, last year, and is cooperating with Mr. Mueller’s team. Elsewhere in Russian election meddling: Here’s what we still don’t know about Facebook’s role. Chris Hughes, a co-founder, said Facebook must do more to prevent foreign interference. President Trump blamed Barack Obama for not being tougher on Russia. And meet the  oligarch who helped fund Russia’s troll agency. The judge overseeing the Justice Department’s lawsuit to block the $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner denied AT&T’s request to see government communications about the case. He ruled that AT&T had not “made a credible showing” that the White House had singled it out for retribution. More from Cecilia Kang of the NYT: The decision puts a crimp in AT&T’s defense for its $85 billion proposed merger with Time Warner. And it is a big win for the Justice Department, which would like to avoid attention on the role of politics in its decision to stop the deal. AT&T had already agreed to take the Justice Department’s antitrust chief, Makan Delrahim, off the witness list — but could call him during the trial if needed.

technology,"By Tiffany Hsu The fledgling plan from Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to create an independent health care system for their American employees is just as bare-bones as it is bold. The companies, all titans in their respective industries, gave few details Tuesday when they announced the joint effort. The group said its strategy will focus first on technology as a way to provide simplified, affordable access to medical services. Beyond that, here are some ideas from health care and medical experts about how the world’s largest online retailer, the largest bank in the United States by assets and the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett’s holding company might reshape an industry. _______ “Amazon could assume drug distribution. They could start to use voice platforms, like Alexa, to help discuss symptoms and get feedback, to coordinate hospital post-op care through voice-activated A.I., to do these and other rote things.” — Dr. Eric Topol, director, Scripps Translational Science Institute in San Diego _______ “Maybe they will develop some kind of algorithm that can be loaded onto any company software to help employers identify the low-hanging fruit, the patients that are using the most care or the highest-cost drugs. These guys have the data resources to really mine what’s going on, to get in the middle of that patient-doctor relationship. But employees are going to have to sign off on letting their employers really dig into that data.” — Erin Fox, senior director of drug information, University of Utah Health Hospitals and Clinics _______ “The companies have a wealthier work force, which tends to have a higher demand for broad networks. And these people are financially very sophisticated in how they do things, so they may be willing to have more complicated benefit design, and more willing to use I.T. tools to shop for care. I hope they work on building value-based insurance design plans, aligning incentives with the value of care.” — Michael E. Chernew, director, HealthCare Markets and Regulation Lab at Harvard Medical School _______ “Most health care is local, even though people occasionally seek care away from home. So the opportunity is in leveraging telecommunications technology, in taking advantage of internet-based services that can be delivered to you everywhere, which is a movement already growing rapidly throughout health care.” — David Lansky, chief executive, Pacific Business Group on Health _______ “With the technology that’s available today, it seems like a logical next step for self-insured companies to administer the health benefit themselves. You could develop a relationship where you’re significantly reducing costs, while still making the providers whole and cutting out so much of the red tape and bureaucracy that currently stymies and frustrates them. The providers’ masters are largely those intermediaries — the health plans, the pharmacy benefit managers. This is a way for companies like Amazon to be the new masters.” — B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive, National Community Pharmacists Association _______ “You can imagine them using a different sort of model, where everyone gets a concierge to help them with their health care, to have a primary care doctor be an independent advocate that helps patients navigate the system, not as an agent of the hospital where they have to feed the beast. And then if you need lab tests, an M.R.I., an elective service in the hospital, you would have a health savings account and a marketplace with transparent pricing. And then, if something really bad happens — you get leukemia, you get hit by a bus — the high-deductible insurance kicks in. That’s the way the market is moving anyway, so I bet this is where these companies are likely going.” — Dr. Rushika Fernandopulle, chief executive, Iora Health, Boston Follow Tiffany Hsu on Twitter: @tiffkhsu.

technology,"Advertisement With Andrew Ross Sorkin APRIL 20, 2018
 Good Friday morning. Here’s what we’re watching: • Wells Fargo takes another hit. • What AT&T’s Randall Stephenson said on the stand. • What Takeda has to weigh in its pursuit of Shire. Get this in your inbox each morning. Sign up here. President Trump took the unusual step of taking on oil prices on his favorite venue on Friday, tweeting his ire at OPEC. Oil prices fell soon after the tweet, with Brent crude posting its biggest intraday drop in weeks. But why has President Trump made the international oil cartel his latest bête noire? One potential reason: It makes life more difficult for many Americans, weighing on the benefits of the Republican tax cuts. The context: OPEC and Russia agreed two years ago to cut — and maintain — oil production caps to bring prices back up in the wake of U.S. shale boom. So far, that strategy has worked: With oil above $73 now, even after Mr. Trump’s tweet, fuel prices are at reaching two-year highs as the U.S. gets into the summer driving season. More importantly, Americans are preparing to spend more on fuel, eating into whatever savings they are expected to receive on average from the tax cuts. Advertisement From Ed Crooks of the FT from earlier this week: Americans are expected to spend an average of $400 per household more on fuel this year than in 2016, as the rebound in crude prices is reflected in the cost of petrol at the pump. By contrast, middle-income US households will on average gain $930 each from the tax cut bill passed at the end of last year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. But as Mr. Crooks also notes, higher fuel prices are less of a burden than they used to be. And OPEC members appear to be taking Mr. Trump’s tweet in stride. Khalid Al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, told Bloomberg, “We have seen prices significantly higher in the past, twice as much as where we are today,” and that the global economy has done fine. Advertisement And Michael Lynch of Strategic Energy & Economic Research had this to say to Bloomberg: “Ninety-eight percent of what politicians say about oil should just be disregarded immediately and this falls in there.” The Justice Department has opened an antitrust investigation into potential coordination by AT&T, Verizon and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, according to six people with knowledge of the inquiry. In February, the Justice Department issued demands to AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A., a mobile industry standards-setting group, for information on potential collusion to thwart a technology known as eSIM, said two of the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. The technology lets people remotely switch wireless providers without having to insert a new SIM card into a device. AT&T and Verizon face accusations that they colluded with the G.S.M.A. to try to establish standards that would allow them to lock a device to their network even if it had eSIM technology. The investigation was opened about five months ago after at least one device maker and one wireless carrier filed formal complaints with the Justice Department, two of the people said. Representatives for the Justice Department, AT&T, Verizon and the G.S.M.A. declined to comment. — Cecilia Kang Shares of General Electric jumped nearly 4 percent Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and reaffirmed its guidance for the year. Though G.E. reported a first-quarter loss on Friday, there were also signs that the struggling industrial giant is beginning to stabilize its business. Advertisement G.E.’s big power-generator division continues to drag down the company’s overall performance, and it is still burdened with financial liabilities that linger from the conglomerate’s pared-back finance arm, GE Capital. But G.E.’s other major industrial divisions, led by aviation and health care, delivered solid results in the quarter. That should provide some assurance to investors as the company charts a future dependent on its industrial lines. Especially heartening for investors, G.E. reaffirmed its profit outlook for the year, predicting earnings per share of $1 to $1.07, though likely at the lower end of that range. Analysts had been skeptical that G.E. could do that well. The average analysts’ forecast for the year was 95 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. With Wells Fargo about to face a $1 billion fine over misdeeds like forcing customers to buy unnecessary auto insurance, Jim Stewart raises a provocative question: Is this too much punishment? To recap: Wells Fargo has already paid $185 million over its fake accounts scandal and set aside $4.25 billion for liabilities tied to other infractions. And the Fed has prevented the bank from expanding its balance sheet. Yes, the upcoming $1 billion fine is the most stringent bank penalty imposed by the Trump administration to date. (The C.F.P.B., under pressure from Mick Mulvaney to go easier on financial firms, is involved here.) But Mr. Stewart writes, “At this point it’s hard to imagine what more Wells Fargo can do (or how much more it can spend) to make amends.” Elsewhere in banking: British financial regulators fined Barclays’s C.E.O., Jes Staley, over his efforts to identify a whistle-blower. Deutsche Bank mistakenly paid $35 billion to Deutsche Börse. (It got the money back.) Advertisement That’s the contention of the reporter Jonathan Greenberg, who, as a Forbes reporter in 1984, spoke with “John Barron” about Donald Trump’s net worth. Mr. Barron — a now well-known alter ego of the real estate executive — contended that Mr. Trump had bought out most of his father’s stake in their business. From Mr. Greenberg’s op-ed in the WaPo: Over time I have learned that he should not have been on the first three Forbes 400 lists at all. In our first-ever list, in 1982, we included him at $100 million, but Trump was actually worth roughly $5 million — a paltry sum by the standards of his super-monied peers — as a spate of government reports and books showed only much later. Mr. Greenberg writes that the White House and the Trump Organization declined to comment. On the stand yesterday, Randall Stephenson argued that his company’s planned takeover of Time Warner would create a business no different from the Silicon Valley giants AT&T sees as its rivals. “The FAANG are all focused on premium video,” Mr. Stephenson said. “All of them are vertically integrated.” The Justice Department, which wants to block the deal, argued that AT&T is different because it’s also a broadband internet provider, and that relations with Silicon Valley are chummier than Mr. Stephenson asserts. Andrew says: If you read one smart thing today, make it this thread by Matthew Ball, the former head of strategy at Amazon Studios. This point is especially insightful: Elsewhere in big media: CBS investors can continue their lawsuit over whether Sumner Redstone was improperly enriched through compensation the board gave him after his health issues made it difficult to function. After what briefly looked like a potential bidding war between Takeda and Allergan — until Allergan dropped out — the question now, Michael writes, is what price will Shire fetch? (Takeda has informally offered over $60 billion.) A big takeover would give Takeda more scale — the combined company would have some $30 billion in annual sales — and a bigger international footprint. But it would also be the company’s biggest takeover by far, and perhaps too expensive. The Japanese drug maker said it intended to maintain its credit rating, which could be difficult if it bids too high — or is pressured to do so by yet another suitor.

Connecticut Water has rejected a $748 million takeover bid by Eversource. Saudi Arabia’s solar project deal with SoftBank exposed infighting between the kingdom’s energy ministry and its sovereign wealth fund. With its $16 trillion economy and reputation for tough negotiating, the E.U. could have been the immovable object in President Trump’s trade fight. But that is looking less likely, Peter Eavis writes. Why? The WSJ reports that the E.U. is prepared to offer concessions to avoid Mr. Trump’s threatened tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that Mr. Trump has threatened — perhaps reducing tariffs on American cars and industrial parts, and joining the U.S. in pressuring China on trade and investment rules. Among the lessons if the E.U. concedes: The U.S.’s large trade deficits can give it leverage. Beijing appears keenly aware of the risks here and is sure to press its case at a China-E.U. summit in July. Elsewhere in trade: Global policymakers in Washington for I.M.F. and World Bank meetings appear worried about a trade war. The Export-Import Bank has been sidelined despite its potential usefulness in trade fights.

But here’s the company's biggest problem, according to Bloomberg’s Peter Waldman, Lizette Chapman and Jordan Robertson: The company needs to figure out how to be rewarded on Wall Street without creeping out Main Street. It might not be possible. For all of Palantir’s professed concern for individuals’ privacy, the single most important safeguard against abuse is the one it’s trying desperately to reduce through automation: human judgment. Now might not seem the ideal time to start a venture capital firm that aims to help U.S. start-ups break into the Russian market. But Fort Ross Ventures, which has opened for business in the U.S. with a $200 million fund, is making a go of it. Victor Orlovski, Fort Ross’s founder and managing partner, told Michael that the current state of U.S.-Russian political relations should not affect his firm’s ability to operate. “The nature of start-ups is all about risk,” he said. “There is a political tension, but not when you’re talking to start-ups.” The tech flyaround • A PWC audit of Facebook last year found sufficient data privacy protections, despite the Cambridge Analytica incident.

technology,"By Cade Metz MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — If you want to understand the priorities of a technology company, first look at the seating chart. At Google’s Silicon Valley headquarters, the chief executive, Sundar Pichai, now shares a floor with Google Brain, a research lab dedicated to artificial intelligence. When Facebook created its own artificial intelligence lab at its offices about seven miles away, it temporarily gave A.I. researchers desks next to the fish bowl of a conference room where its chief executive and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, holds his meetings. “I can high-five Mark and Sheryl from my desk, and the A.I. team was right next to us,” said Facebook’s chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, referring to Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer. Even Overstock.com, the online retailer based in the Salt Lake City area, now runs a mini-research operation called OLabs. It sits directly outside the office of the company’s chief executive, Patrick Byrne. A growing number of tech companies are pushing research labs and other far-reaching engineering efforts closer to the boss. The point is unmistakable: What they are doing matters to the chief executive. It may even be the future of the company. “The world is moving faster and faster. It is being driven by technology and innovation,” said John Kotter, an emeritus professor at Harvard Business School who has written several books on business leadership. “And a lot of these businesses are concluding that the speed of technological innovation should be the heart of everything.” A year ago, the Google Brain team of mathematicians, coders and hardware engineers sat in a small office building on the other side of the company’s campus. But over the past few months, it switched buildings and now works right beside the loungelike area where Mr. Pichai and other top executives work. Jeffrey Dean, the celebrated Google engineer who oversees the Brain lab, is a short walk from Mr. Pichai. So are Ian Goodfellow, the researcher behind a new A.I. technique that generates lifelike images on its own, and Norm Jouppi, who explores ways of accelerating A.I. research through a new breed of computer chip. “Any C.E.O. thinks a lot about where people are sitting — who they can walk around and have casual conversations with,” said Diane Greene, who oversees Google’s cloud computing team and sits on the board of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. “It is a very significant statement that he has moved that group right next him.” Google is placing big bets on the A.I. being explored by researchers like Mr. Goodfellow. Many questions still hang over the progress of this research. But Mr. Pichai and the rest of the Google leadership hope it will accelerate the evolution of everything from smartphones and home appliances to internet services and robotics. To Mr. Byrne, shaking up the seating chart at Overstock was a bit like a common management tactic in the military, when an officer will work closely with a small “command initiatives group” that is considerably more nimble than the rest of the organization. “We were getting bureaucratic,” Mr. Byrne said. “And this was a way of creating added competition outside the bureaucracy.” These big companies are trying to duplicate the vibe of a Silicon Valley start-up, where the boss is next to everyone. As start-ups grow, they often put key technology teams next to the chief executive. Ms. Greene, who was the chief executive of the software company VMware, said she had always made a point of sitting beside the top engineers because they saw the company’s future. There are limits to these arrangements. When Facebook built a team to explore the future of virtual reality on its vast social network, it made a similar desk move. The group is no longer seated next to Mr. Zuckerberg. Facebook said this was because the group had grown too large. But across Silicon Valley, virtual reality is no longer the buzziest of topics. That honor belongs to artificial intelligence. Where you sit has mattered for years at Facebook. The company’s ad group traditionally sat far away from Mr. Zuckerberg. But after Facebook went public and started a big push for revenue, important members of the ad team moved next to the boss, said Antonio García Martínez, who wrote a book about his experiences inside Facebook. At Overstock, Mr. Byrne walks past his small research team every time he leaves his office. Like Ms. Greene, he sees this as an opportunity for spontaneous interaction. The team members can discuss their work with him, and Mr. Byrne, a doctor of philosophy with a long history of unorthodox business choices, will share his far-reaching ideas with them. And he gets to hear, without the pressure of a formal presentation, what the engineers are excited about. “It was undeniable that proximity sparked conversation,” said Judd Bagley, a kind of roving technologist and strategist who once worked in this group. “Patrick prides himself on being able to walk up to anyone at the company, say ‘hello,’ and occasionally even eat french fries off the plate on their desk.” Through OLabs, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept payment in the Bitcoin digital currency, and the lab eventually produced a company spinoff that seeks to apply the Bitcoin ethos to financial trading. Now, in an echo of the A.I. labs at Google and Facebook, the operation is focused on machine learning, which involves systems that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing large amounts of data. If a chief executive is close to these researchers, he or she is learning from them. But the boss is also showing them how important they are to the company. That is enormously valuable for engineers and mathematicians who are not necessarily generating immediate revenue, said Kevin Quennesson, a start-up executive who ran an A.I. team at Twitter. He also warned that companies risked putting too much pressure on researchers to produce results from work that was, by definition, a trip into the unknown. Amid so much spontaneous conversation with the chief executive, Mr. Bagley said, it is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between “the formal direction and informal brainstorming.” Status at Facebook was defined by how close your desk was to Mr. Zuckerberg, Mr. Martínez said. And if you were close to the boss, other groups resented you. Priorities also tend to ebb and flow. At Overstock, a new Bitcoin project will squeeze in beside OLabs. And at Facebook, the A.I. lab is no longer side by side with Mr. Zuckerberg because it also grew too large. Still, this work is particularly important to the company as it works to ensure “the safety and integrity of our community” — which has become Facebook code for guarding against false, misleading or dangerous activity on its social network, Mr. Schroepfer said. And the A.I. team is still only a short walk from Mr. Zuckerberg.     Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
technology,"Asia and Australia Edition By Charles McDermid (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. Trade retaliation, murmurs of dissent in China and overlooked obituaries. Here’s what you need to know:  • President Trump signed off on tough tariffs on steel and aluminum, promising to be “very flexible” after facing a global outcry. The tariffs have raised fears of retaliation. “Choosing a trade war is a mistaken prescription,” China’s foreign minister said. (Our senior economics correspondent calls it more of a “skirmish.”) Mr. Trump suggested some allies, including Canada, Mexico and Australia, might be spared. But some nations aren’t taking any chances. A group of 11 — including Australia, New Zealand and Japan — signed a broad free trade deal in a direct challenge to Mr. Trump’s protectionist agenda. And our news podcast, “The Daily,” examines Mr. Trump’s claims about tariffs and trade deficits. _____ • China is all but certain this weekend to throw out a 1982 rule that has restricted the country’s presidents to two five-year terms. The beneficiary, President Xi Jinping, could be in power for life. To position himself for this moment, our correspondent writes, Mr. Xi “deployed speed, secrecy and intimidation to smother potential opposition inside and outside the party.” Here’s a look at Mr. Xi’s rise to power. Despite the display of support, murmurings of opposition suggest that Mr. Xi and his subordinates have not fully sold the idea to a broader public. Such stirrings of discontent, our Beijing correspondents write, could build over time. _____ • The U.S.-China rivalry is increasingly focused on technology, and at the center of that dispute is 5G, shorthand for fifth-generation wireless technology. Here’s a look at why companies and countries are fighting for 5G dominance. Huawei was a bit player in shaping today’s cellular networks. Now, as 5G approaches, the Chinese telecom giant, is determined to lead the pack, worrying Washington. “It’s a commercial advantage which parlays itself into a security advantage,” one expert said. “Whoever controls the technology knows, intimately, how it was built and where all the doors and buttons are.” _____ • The U.S. secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, is on a five-nation tour of Africa, warning against Chinese investment and wearing a tight smile when asked about President Trump’s insulting description of the continent. Separately, in our latest visual investigation, we show how villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been destroyed in recent attacks, forcing 140,000 people to flee. This Times Insider piece explains how we used active-fire data from NASA and Openstreetmap to bring the atrocities to light. _____ • “There’s a lot to fight for.” That’s how one woman summed up the mood on International Women’s Day, which was marked with a sense of urgency this year, in the era of #MeToo and Time’s Up. At The Times, we unveiled a project, “Overlooked,” that starts with the stories of 15 remarkable women who did not receive a Times obituary. The names are surprising: Sylvia Plath, Ida B. Wells, the Bollywood legend Madhubala and Qui Jin, China’s Joan of Arc. Our editor discussed how the idea came to her, and a veteran of the Obituaries desk pondered the historical imbalance. Do you have a suggestion for the series? • Samsung’s new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S9, arrives with a new feature, AR Emoji, that uses a selfie to create an animated avatar.

If you go, here’s what to pack. President Trump has recently conducted a series of televised conversations with lawmakers as well as with regular citizens. Forty-one years ago, President Jimmy Carter held a similar unscripted discussion, answering questions from callers during a live radio broadcast from the Oval Office. “Ask President Carter,” moderated by the CBS anchor Walter Cronkite, was broadcast on the afternoon of March 5, 1977. (You can read a transcript here.) Mr. Cronkite invited listeners to call the White House at 900‐242‐1611. According to CBS, more than 9 million Americans tried. Some of the dozens of questions that Mr. Carter answered were distinctively of the late 1970s: about the gas tax, Mr. Carter’s pardoning of draft dodgers in Vietnam and the early days of the U.S. space shuttle program. Others — about tax overhaul, drug abuse and relations with Cuba — still resonate today. One caller asked why members of Congress were getting a $12,000 raise while Mr. Carter was proposing that taxpayers receive a rebate of only $50. “Gerald, that is a hard question for me to answer,” Mr. Carter replied. “I’m sure it is,” the caller said. “That’s why I thought I would throw it at you.” The program caught the public’s attention (“Saturday Night Live” ran a spoof the next week), but it was never repeated.

Here’s what we’re watching: • How foreign is Broadcom? • The markets are worried that free trade has no voice at the White House. • The E.U. formally announced its plan for any Trump tariffs. • Chuck Rosenberg, a former senior official at the Justice Department, is going to Crowell & Moring. Want this in your inbox each morning? Sign up here. As the Trump administration weighs whether to block the chip maker’s $117 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm, a central issue is how much of a threat the deal is to national security. In an effort to assuage concerns, Broadcom pledged Wednesday to increase research spending on 5G wireless tech and to create a $1.5 billion fund to invest in training engineering talent in the United States to help allay those concerns. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or Cfius, has jurisdiction over the transaction because Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore, where the company has been legally headquartered since 2005. But the company is preparing to move its corporate base to the United States, in part to avoid being considered a foreign acquirer. Advertisement Beyond Broadcom’s legal domicile, though, is it a substantially foreign company? Let’s take a look at a number of factors. Advertisement Sales First, a caveat: Both Broadcom and Qualcomm categorize where their revenue based on the location to which the chips that go in the smartphones and other devices are delivered. As Qualcomm puts it:  “China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.” According to Broadcom’s most recent annual report, roughly 7 percent of its $17.6 billion in net revenue comes from the United States. The single biggest market for the company is China, which accounted for roughly 54 percent of its net revenue. “Other” markets made up nearly 38 percent. As a point of comparison, 2 percent of Qualcomm’s revenues come from the United States. Some 65 percent of its revenue comes from China, including Hong Kong, according to its most recent annual report. Employees Roughly 55 percent of Broadcom’s employees are based in North America, according to the annual report. About 38 percent are in Asia, and the remainder work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. About 52 percent of Qualcomm’s employees are based in the United States. Broadcom also said that about 62 percent of the square footage of its properties, both owned and leased, are in the United States. By contrast, Qualcomm has roughly 56 percent of its owned and leased facilities in the United States. Corporate governance The vast majority of Broadcom’s board are American citizens who live in the United States. That includes Jim Diller, its chairman; Henry Samueli, the founder of the original Broadcom; and Ken Hao, the Silver Lake partner who has backed Broadcom for years. Hock Tan, the company’s C.E.O., immigrated to the United States to attend M.I.T. and then Harvard Business School and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990. Broadcom does have one Singaporean director, Check Low, to comply with Singapore’s corporate rules. Advertisement Ownership The two companies share 11 of their top 20 shareholders, including big index fund managers like BlackRock and Vanguard. — Michael de la Merced President Trump’s top economic adviser finally announced he would leave, in a sign that the nationalists have won the White House debate on tariffs. The news prompted Tom Nides, Morgan Stanley’s vice chairman, to utter aloud, “Oh, that’s a problem.” More on Mr. Cohn’s decision from Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman of the NYT, who broke the news yesterday: It leaves Mr. Trump surrounded primarily by advisers with strong protectionist views who advocate the types of aggressive trade measures, like tariffs, that Mr. Trump campaigned on but that Mr. Cohn fought inside the White House. Mr. Cohn was viewed by Republican lawmakers as the steady hand who could prevent Mr. Trump from engaging in activities that could trigger a trade war. Potential replacements, according to Axios: Peter Navarro, the trade adviser who pushed for the tariffs; Kevin Warsh, the former Fed governor; Shahira Knight, a deputy of Mr. Cohn’s; and the pro-free-trade economist Larry Kudlow. But Axios says that there’s no official succession plan, and that other members of the National Economic Council will likely leave (We can rule out Austan Goolsbee.) The timing: CNBC notes that Mr. Cohn’s announcement came hours after Mr. Trump said that “everyone wants to work in the White House.” It also came after Mr. Trump tweeted, “There is no Chaos, only great Energy!” Peter Eavis’s take: Even if there is no plunge, now is a moment for investors to make up their minds about populism. Critics’ corner: The WSJ editorial board said Mr. Cohn’s departure was “a significant blow” to Mr. Trump’s presidency. The NYT editorial board said Mr. Cohn had done “an awful job,” which still probably represented “the high-water mark for economic thinking” for this White House. And his former boss, Lloyd Blankfein, said he had served his country “in a first class way.” The Federal Reserve has helped support the economy when a big event – fears for the survival of the euro, fiscal standoffs in Congress, oil price declines — threatens to dampen growth. But will the Fed have the same leeway to stimulate the economy if rising trade tensions start to weigh on the growth prospects of the United States? Advertisement Maybe not. The Fed had ample room to keep its policy loose when inflation was dormant for years after the financial crisis. But now that inflation seems to be waking up, the Fed might not have the same flexibility. Indeed, amid the current trade tumult, investors still seem to believe that inflation is moving higher. This can be seen in a closely watched bond market indicator flagged this morning by Lisa Abramowicz of Bloomberg. 
            As fears of a trade war heat up, U.S. inflation expectations over the next five years have risen to the highest since 2013, as per 5-year forward breakeven contracts. pic.twitter.com/ZgXyYqxh6c  One outcome: The concerns about a trade war may end up weighing on growth and causing the inflationary pressures to abate. That would give the Fed more room to maneuver, perhaps allowing it to raise interest rates more slowly. But it could get messy. Trade tariffs, applied broadly, could push up the prices of many goods at a time when the Fed has to grapple with the enormous fiscal stimulus that Congress just enacted. - Peter Eavis Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard became the latest policymaker to express confidence that inflation would hit the Fed’s target of 2 percent this year. “Mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view. With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.” What are those tailwinds? “The most notable tailwind is the shift in America’s fiscal policy stance from restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.” Ms. Brainard’s comments are notable because she had previously argued vocally for caution in tightening monetary policy. Major stocks indexes in the United States are down a bit. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S.&P. 500 are both off just over 0.5 percent. Futures fell more than 1 percent in the hours after the news broke. Despite the muted response, a number of analysts are warning that investors need to prepare for the possibility that more protectionist/populist policies are on the way. Here’s a look at some reactions: Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM US, wrote:  “The resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no to little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy. His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject to the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda: that it could debt finance a $1.5 trillion dollar tax cut (with a $750 billion fudge factor) and then throw an additional $320 billion in kerosene on top of the debt fueled flames without stoking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain to follow in its wake. No economic advisor, whatever their academic or professional background will be able to liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White House.” Brian Gardner and Michael Michaud, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote:  “Regardless of whether Mr. Cohn’s replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist, investors need to realize that President Trump’s populist rhetoric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not. To date, investors have been assuaged that Mr. Cohn was the “adult in the room” in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulatory policy that was the case. However, we think trade policy is different and investors need to understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global trade.” What does that mean? The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than not to withdraw from Nafta. Charlie McElligott at Nomura Securities wrote:  “It still feels that collective investor mentality views this as little-more than a political ploy to galvanize Trump’s core constituency into mid-term elections, a game-theory standoff to draw-out trade concessions from China.” But he adds: “It does “pull forward” risk of the “Bad Trump” scenario which that market had largely “priced-out” into the “now.” Between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, the billionaire investor sold about $31 million of the crane maker's stock. Advertisement To some, that seemed like good timing. Since the day before he started selling, the stock is down 20 percent. The catalyst? The Trump administration’s plans to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Manitowoc stock fell 4.8 percent on Feb. 16 when Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross unveiled a report calling for tariffs on imported steel. The company’s shares then dropped 6 percent Thursday when President Trump announced his plan. On Wednesday, Mr. Icahn said he had no knowledge of the Trump administration’s plans when he moved to reduce his holding. In a statement on his website, Mr. Icahn said: “We don’t generally comment on rumors, but the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record: Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration’s announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.” The political bloc formally announced its plan to counterattack, including taxing American goods like Harley-Davidsons and bourbon and filing a challenge with the World Trade Organization. Meanwhile, allies continued to fret. South Korea worries that tariffs will complicate its efforts to denuclearize the North. Christine Lagarde of the I.M.F. warned of the perils of a trade war. And fellow Republicans in Washington continued to lobby the White House. The aluminum industry doesn’t want tariffs either In a letter to the White House yesterday, the Aluminum Association (which represents both U.S. and foreign suppliers) said that the move would be a bad idea. Complaints can be heard around the sector. The C.E.O. of Novelis, a big aluminum producer, criticized Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for saying predictions of price increases were “hysteria.” And DowDuPont said it might now build plants in Canada or Argentina rather than the U.S. Bayer said it is in exclusive talks with BASF about the sale of its entire vegetable seeds business as the German chemicals multinational, seeks to win approval for its $56 billion deal for Monsanto from European regulators. European antitrust regulators opened an in-depth investigation into Bayer’s planned acquisition of Monsanto, its American agribusiness rival, in August. European competition authorities are expected to wrap up their inquiry by early next month.

Its “private equity” cost-cutting could lead to Qualcomm reducing investment in R. & D. and ceding its 5G lead to Huawei of China, according to the letter.

technology,"By Alexis Soloski It takes a lot to sustain human life. You need the right temperature, atmosphere and gravity; some water, enough nutrients, not too many volcanoes. And in Don Nguyen’s “Hello, From the Children of Planet Earth,” you also need a willing sperm donor. Ambitious and labored, Mr. Nguyen’s play, produced by the Playwrights Realm at the Duke on 42nd Street, is set in the misty long ago of 2012. Directed by Jade King Carroll, it twins Voyager 1’s journey toward interstellar space with a lesbian couple’s attempt to fertilize an egg. Betsy (Kaaron Briscoe), an Amnesty International advocacy director, and Shoshana (Dana Berger), a farm-to-table chef, have maxed out their accounts on I.V.F., so now they’re trying a budget option, D.I.Y. insemination. For reasons that are less than fully explicable, they’ve contacted William (Jeffrey Omura), Betsy’s high school pal, even though the two haven’t talked in 17 years. (Was there a rift? No. Just a plot hole.) William is a NASA aerospace engineer responsible for the space probe Voyager 1’s firmware, so the play piles most of its metaphors — about spaces and places and heartbeats and homes — onto his narrow, business-casual shoulders. When William thinks that Betsy and Shoshana are inviting him over for sex, he’s interested. When he learns their plans for a hot night lean toward a sterile cup and a stack of porn magazines, he’s less certain. He’d rather focus his care and attention on an object billions of miles away than an ovum nearby. Mr. Nguyen has a fine concept and a genuine sweetness to his writing, despite a few mild gross-out moments, most courtesy of William’s boorish, bro-ish, Cheetos-obsessed office mate, Freddy (Jon Hoche). But sustaining human life onstage? That’s tricky, too. And the performances and dialogue don’t always manage it. Here’s the play’s first line, delivered postcoitally: “So … um … I’m sorry I screamed in your vagina.” The characters feel like rough sketches — a job, a few traits — rather than people and despite a few nicely observed moments, they act in ways that have less to do with human behavior than with Mr. Nguyen setting up jokes and set pieces. One of those involves a copy of “Little Woman” put to prurient purpose. (Also, why does everyone wear the same clothes for four months straight?) Still, the space-age set (designed by Kimie Nishikawa), a riot of geometric furniture, bulbs and LEDs (the lighting is by Nicole Pearce), is a treat. And when the stage realism fails, there are enjoyably surreal interludes, courtesy of a creature called the Farthest Explorer, a humanoid version of Voyager 1, who zooms through space carrying a golden record etched with greetings in dozens of languages as well as whale songs and “Johnny B. Goode.” Played with cheery wonder by the adorable Olivia Oguma, she offers disquisitions on the universe, catastrophe and community. She also delivers the play’s moral: “These humans’ deep and sometimes overzealous desire to connect to others is, well … super cute.” This information was last updated on March 23, 2018 Hello, From the Children of Planet EarthThrough March 24 at the Duke on 42nd Street; 646-223-3010, playwrightsrealm.org.

technology,"Current Events Conversation By The Learning Network Though the end of school year 2017-18 is in sight, we still get excited when we see new classes joining the conversation. This week we welcome students from Oxford, Miss., and Leland, Mich.  But we also have to tell you that this is the last time this semester we’ll be choosing favorite student comments on our daily writing prompts. Instead, we invite you to transition from commenting on pieces we’ve chosen to choosing articles on your own. As you do, you’ll be practicing for our Summer Reading Contest, which poses the same question every Friday: “What interested you most in The Times this week? Why?” Since the contest doesn’t start until June 15, we reached out to a few teachers we’ve gotten to know and asked how their students would answer that question right now. Here are 17 great answers, which will introduce you to articles on everything from naked museum tours to A.I. technology. Want your pick chosen next week? Post a comment here or here telling us what you’re reading and why. We can’t wait to add your ideas to our list. Please note: All the student comments below have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear exactly as they were originally submitted. _________ Our most popular writing prompt this week asked students “Are You a Fortnite Addict?”  Sloth Jesus from Wilmington, N.C., — with the most recommended comment — paints this vivid picture of what it’s like to play Fortnite: For a lot of people, Fortnite is just a game you can play with your friends when you are caught up with your homework after school, to have fun and relax, right? For others, it is a completely different experience. It becomes a bit of a life or death situation, as extreme as it sounds. You have to trust your squad mates with your life, or else, you’re as good as dead. It’s kind of an awesome feeling: you and your friends all together against multiple other groups of friends. You battle it out in building and gun play to defeat your opponents. Overall it is a very fun game, that builds enjoyment and experience in stressful situations that help you build better relationships with your friends. When I play with my friends, we are all in a party, or a chatroom, constantly talking about whatever comes to our minds. Its nothing too serious, until someone hears a gunshot at our squad. “Did you guys hear about what happened in 3rd block today?” *Gunshot* “Shots, 330 NW” someone says. The entire conversation changes. From conversation to callouts, in an absolute instant. Your team gets ready to face the coming threat. The addiction itself comes from winning, in my belief. From dropping Salty Springs to running and gunning around the map with a deadly storm pitting the final survivors against one another, to the final battle atop a great mountain, to seeing the words “Victory Royale!” on your screen. It’s a rush of satisfaction and joy, because you won. Daniel Lee from California gives some reasons for why it’s so popular: An immense topic of discussion is the creeping shadow of “Fortnite,” an online multiplayer shooting game. When I first heard of it, I diminished it as a minor and simple video game that might gain some popularity and die off in the duration of a few months. However, the number one thing that my friends talk about aren’t the plot twists of Infinity War, nor the difficulty of the math test on Tuesday, but whether or not they should buy a skin for their character in Fortnite to look decent enough when they’re firing at another player. Video games alone are addicting, but a game such as “Fornite” has the potential to become a sort of black hole, an endless void that squeezes the reason and sense out of students like myself. The most appealing aspect of Fortnite is the gameplay of a mode called Battle Royale. Well over 30 characters are set down in a continuously shrinking arena, where they can accumulate weapons and tools, build complex structures, and prepare for the battle that will determine to the be the winner. A laughable model of The Hunger Games, I didn’t and still to this day never did understand why my friends would want to play the game, which, to me, was as addictive and attractive as watching paint dry on a wall. However, to my friends, “Fortnite” sees like an island in a sea of mediocre video games; a spark of imagination in a dark time. Jessica from Fla. says Fornite has consumed her school, but she doesn’t think the game is toxic: I can say from experience that Fortnite is in fact a very addicting and enjoyable game. I recently downloaded because of all the hype, and play it on a regular basis with my friend. I wouldn’t say that I personally am addicted to the game, however, I do find myself playing it in my free time. To be quite honest, I’m not even sure why exactly the game is so popular. The graphics are really pretty and the concept is nice, but it’s just one of hundreds of shooting video games that exist. I do think that at my school, Fortnite has become something that consumes a lot of time from nearly all the students. It’s constantly being talked about and played by students (including myself) during class time throughout the day. I’ve even noticed that people will post all of their wins or the “victory royale” screen on their social media such as on snapchat. Sometimes people will post as much as 4 or 5 pictures of the gaming screen everytime they win, which can end up being really annoying in my opinion. Although this game is so popular and may consume the time of a lot of individuals, I do not believe that it has any truly toxic effects on those who play it. I honestly think it’s just another really hyped up video game that will eventually die down over time. Abe Barerra from Oregon and his parents came up with rules to to curb his Fornite addiction: Hello I’m a 15 year old kid here. After reading this article and scrutinizing the comment section, I have come to the conclusion that people generally have two sides in this lively debate. While some people state that Violent Games (Fortnite or other Games in General) tend to lead to violent aggression, there is other people who believe that games lead to social and life skills. I can agree with both sides of the conversation. For example I play video games as well, with a few wins on fortnite myself I can agree that the game itself is very addicting, This game creates a gambling affect that makes it hard for people to stop, I know that when I am told to stop by my parents, I feel anger, and that’s just not normal. The problem with this is, that this anger is just temporary, I wont feel any more later, but like trying to stop a gambler from playing poker, its really hard to get someone to just stop playing video games. There is also the benefits of video games, from being able to cooperate with each other in a similar social settings, to enhance memory, improve coordination and improves problem solving skills. The solution that my parents and I cooperated, We put up a set of rules for the weekday, I cannot play video games without first studying, doing homework, chores, and even then, the most I can play is around 1 hour 30 min. In the weekend the rules are similar but with a few changes. I cannot play without studying and chores, I can play but I also need to go outside. Lila Sternoff from New York says it can be a great way for less social people to make friends: I think that its important to recognize that people socialize different ways, and wanting to engage in an activity that they feel comfortable with. Many young people make friends by playing a sport, or participating in a after school activity, and those are both great ways to make friends if that works for you, but many children are just not interested in those activities, and their participation would not be a positive experience for them. Nobody ever calls a child who loves baseball a “baseball addict” in a negative way, and I believe that no one should be criticized with the way that they enjoy themselves. Fortnite is a positive outlet for children to play with friends, feel strong, and have something that they can be proud of accomplishing. Fornite does not create addicts, it creates enjoyable experiences. Mekiyah Hazbin from Colorado, who has made many friends playing Fortnite, agrees: Hello. My name is Mekiyah Hazbin, I go to Liberty Middle school and I am currently in the 7th grade. While I’ve read many news articles and heard many opinions. Some say games like Fortnite and PUBG are addicting and ruin social bonds. I completely disagree. When I began playing Fortnite, it was mid October. I didn’t really play the game. When I did, I did it by myself. Then in late December I went over to a friends house. We played Fortnite together for hours. I really began to like this game and by January, it was one of my top games. But, I still didn’t have anyone to play with. That friend played Ps4 and I was on Xbox. That’s when it hit my school. Fortnite began to be in every conversation. I found people I liked to play with. People I would’ve never met if didn’t play. I met people out of state, and out of country. Yet we still play together and chat together as if we’ve known each other for years. Fortnite is addicting because everyone want to be a winner. They want to feel that sense of accomplishment. They want to say, “I’m better than 100 other people.” If people continue to hate on those who play games, they need to stop. Discouraging someone from completing their goals is wrong. Whether the goal is to become a super star or to finally get that victory royale, no one should think they can’t do something. And as for the game’s violence? Jake M from NH has this to say: I have played Fortnite for almost 3 months now and I have never seen violence being an issue in the game play. There are guns in the game, but the game is more like a game of virtual airsoft being that there is no blood and your character doesn’t actually die, but they get teleported off the island. The game is more cartoony and humorous than violent. The characters dance to send taunts and they have weapons like the “boogey bomb” which makes all the players that been hit by the bomb dance for 20 - 30 seconds. For comparison, Fortnite is not much more violent than Tom and Jerry the kids cartoon. Also, kids these days are playing games like Grand Theft Auto where there is much more blood and violence than Fortnite. So I don’t think that Fortnite has too much violence and that it is suitable for younger people. _________ Our Student Opinion prompt ""What Role Does Envy Play in Your Life?"" asked students if feeling envious makes them want to work harder — or give up — and how it feels to be the envy of others. Tyler Skipworth from Oxford, Miss., has learned how to handle the emotion: My experience with envy has changed through my life. It use to be that when I was little, I had fought or tried to get what I wanted from someone, like a toy. Now, when I see someone with something better then me, I either go like good for you, say how lucky they are compared to me, or do my best to get where they are. That last one is how I hope envy is a part of my adulthood when I grow up, because I think it is a responsible way to use envy to your advantage. Micah Cantor from Hastings on Hudson, N.Y., says accepting it is the best way to overcome it: I think that envy is directly related to competitiveness, but it is often confused with jealousy, which can occur without competition. Under Aristotle’s definition, that envy is the feeling of pain from other’s accomplishments, I only feel that pain when comparing myself to a peer, whom I’m in competition with, and not when comparing myself to a stranger. This distinction is important because I don’t think that a little bit of jealousy of a stranger or peer is a bad thing; it only becomes dangerous when their accomplishments convert into personal feelings of anger or despair. One of the ways to overcome hurtful feelings of envy is not to suppress it, but accept it and realize that any comparison or competition between oneself and others is unnecessary. Once the aspect of competition is relinquished, the envy turns into simple admiration. Ella Thompson from Oxford, Miss., thinks envy is linked to approval: I think that envy relates to competitiveness mostly in sports. Whenever someone comes before meet in a school cross country meet, it seem that that person get congratulated more. I might have been first for the team last meet but you failed this time and people think better of her. That is how envy feels. Envy continues to grow inside me. Then is spend the next week training harder and harder just to beat so-and-so to get lots of approval. I think that envy is linked to approval or praise in a way. Whenever someone is getting more attention then me, even though we did the same thing, I get envious. It is just our human nature. This is why I agree that envy is related to competitiveness. It might be bad or unsportsmanlike but it is true. At least for me. Molly Furman from Hastings-on-Hudson says social media makes envy worse: I completely agree that social media is a huge source of envy because people typically only see or post the best moments, snapshots, of their lives. Social Media has become a platform to brag about the new award you won, the places you traveled to, or the friendships you made or already had. While social media is an amazing place to express one’s individuality, it also leads to people feeling insecure, less than, or extremely envious of a person they know of or a complete stranger. It makes you take a step back when you realize how often people envy other people’s lives and stop living their own because they are attached to their screen. Dannielle Geneus from New Jersey understands when it most often afflicts her: Mostly when envy plays in my life its mostly because of looks. When I see women that looks prettier than me, it would bring me down at time . I would just be like...dang I wish I was like that then get mad jealous. Jordyn Ives from Westfield, N.J., says envy is a motivator: Whenever I envy somebody or something, I am motivated to get whatever I was jealous of. Even when I was little and saw a toy that another little girl had, I saved up, until I got my reward. And now, as a teenager, I use the power of envy as a force in my everyday life. If one of my friends gets a higher grade than me, of course, I would feel envy. So when it came time to take the next exam, I would think back to that moment, and remember what it is that I want: the higher grade. This can be boiled down to competition, because I have a desire to always be on top. _________ Our most eloquent responses this week may have come in reaction to our Student Opinion question “Is the Digital Era Improving or Ruining the Experience of Art?”: Maddy Grosvenor from Leland, Mich., thinks it should be experienced face-to-face: In my opinion, I think art is best experienced in person. Not that it is impossible for art to be appreciated online or in a book, but to really gain the full experience I think it is best to see them in the flesh. Many of the most famous artworks displayed in museums were made long before art was printed into books and posted on the internet. The artist’s intention was for his/her audience to view them in person, so would that not be the best way to appreciate them? A piece of art that I would love to see in person would have to be a Jackson Pollock piece. By looking at pictures of it online, it is impossible to comprehend the sheer size and the presence it holds in a room. This is one huge drawback you see with viewing art nowadays, because so much of the art we see is online. There is absolutely no way to get the full experience of a piece behind a screen. However, with the internet we can quickly and efficiently see art we would never be able to see without spending money on a plane ticket. Still, I think that the digital era is somewhat ruining the experience of viewing art. It has made it more about visiting museums and having the “I was there” picture than actually appreciating and learning about the art. Colin Satterwhite from Leland, Mich., agrees, saying art can evoke strong emotions: Prompt One: I think art is meant to be experience in person. I think the meaning of the art is magnified in person and captured in a way that couldn’t be otherwise. I think visual art should be seen in museums. That way, the viewer can get a personal impression of the work that isn’t digital. For me, music is the most important form of art. I know that I’d rather see any song in person at a live concert than through my earbuds at home. I think seeing music in person generates more emotion as you get the atmosphere of a crowd and it’s almost as though you get to interact with the artist and their music. I think the type of art depends on whether the media should be viewed with a group or as an individual. I think are is meant to be experience both intellectually and emotionally. I think art is meant to appeal to all types of things. Art can not only make you think about certain messages, but also appeal to several emotions. I think this is what makes art so special; there is a type for every individual. Cobe Lund from MI says different art forms should be experienced in different ways: In my opinion, different forms of art are meant to be experienced in different ways. People can have a different outcome of feelings towards a work of art if their experience isn’t the same as another persons. I think works of art like the Mona Lisa are meant to be experienced in person, individually, and emotionally whereas works of art like dances are meant to be viewed online and in a group. This is because so much detail can go into a painting and if its not inspected closely, meaning can be lost. On the other hand, with works like dances, the filming and production of the video can add to the overall routine. Also, a whole group can enjoy and try to participate as the work is playing. Benefits of the digital era with art is editing, production quality, and easier sharing opportunities. The main drawback is people trying to get the experience of art online that is meant to be viewed in person and up close. Overall, I think the digital era is improving the experience of art because technology has opened so many doors and possibilities to create new, groundbreaking types of art. Nathanie Doralus from Florida believes it depends on the viewer: Art is meant to be experienced in whatever way is best for the viewer to fully receive the full effect and understanding intended by the artist. Whether that method is in person, online or in books, depends on the viewer and their accessibility to the artwork. I think the initial power lies in the artist’s hands to choose a format that they believe will reach and impact the most people. Those people then obtain the power to share the art with others to experience it in different ways. Works of art I would like to see in person are the recent presidential portraits of Barack and Michelle Obama in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington D.C. I want to experience this in person because I think that would be the best way to remember and revel in the existence of a black president and first lady of the United States, whose portraits were created by black artists. That kind of art is weighted in such a rich and painful history that I want to say I have seen with my own eyes in real life. I have seen the portraits online, and though it brought me so much joy, it made me yearn to see it in person. The digital images showed people witnessing the art for the first time in real life. Their reactions prove that seeing it in person can have a great impact also. The digital era was given artists the tools to share their creations with larger audiences. Viewers have the right to seek other ways of experiencing art. I would think the goal of artists would be to share it with the masses. But Mollie Grishaw from Leland, Mich., says the best thing about art is that there are no rules for it: One of the most beautiful things about art is the fact that nothing about it is set in stone. There are no definitive laws or theories like there are in the natural sciences. Because of this variability, art isn’t meant to be experienced in any single way. Some types of art are best experienced in a museum, which creates a certain atmosphere of seriousness and formality. Seeing the most famous art works in a museum is a very different experience than seeing them in a book or on a screen, and to some, the former might be the best way to experience them whereas for others it may be the latter. It rests on the preferences of the beholder. I once went to the Detroit Institute of Art, and I could have easily spent innumerable hours there, examining the artwork of different ages and areas. It was a very different experience than seeing a painting on a screen. It became more real, more 3-D. This is definitely a drawback of the digital era. We lose the physicality and dimensions of the world on the flat surface of our screens. How can you ever be sure of the height of a mountain if you only ever see a picture? On the other hand, works of art have never been more accessible than they are now. With simply the touch of a button and a few typed words you can view almost any work of art that you want. With technology, we are able to experience so much more art than if we had to travel to see it. Thus, the impact of the digital age on experiencing art can easily be argued both ways. Jessica Pershinske from Leland, Mich., thinks the way artists make and share their art is changing with the times: As the digital age progresses and becomes more influential in our day-to-day lives, art has been forced to change its ways. Originally, a piece of art was meant to be observed in the flesh, allowing us to view each brush stroke on the canvas. Today, art can come in nearly any form. The ability to view art in person is no longer required. Rather, some art is created purely for its online availability. Take a photographer that purely takes photos to be displayed online. Does viewing these photos give us the same experience as viewing them in person would? Probably not, but to say that viewing them would have no worth at all would be to undermine the value of today’s artists. In this way, art isn’t simply meant to be experienced in one specific way. Instead, it takes the form of anything and everything, and the way in which we view it changes our outlook on it. Emiko Andrews from Wilmington, N.C., believes that the Internet is making physical art more “sacred”: While it’s disheartening to me that many people only choose to experience art by taking pictures of famous works, I think it’s a sign of a shift in how we can view and create art in the 21st century. Physical art done with oil paint on canvas is now joining other mediums like digital art and cartoons, which can be distributed online, along with pictures of traditional works of art. I believe that this has caused us to see the physical works of art as something sacred, that we must see just for the experience, and take pictures to capture the memory. As Li said, “I can see [the Mona Lisa] better in a book or on the internet.” Of course there are countless ways to experience art, but it may be of value for us to take more time to consider what we really look for in art, rather than just notoriety. To summarize, it’s my belief that in a time when art in all of its forms is so accessible, we should look for art that has meaning for us, not just that which has a famous name attached. Alice Ongaro from Leland, Mich., sees both the benefits and drawbacks of art in the digital era: Everyone’s art experience is individual and experienced differently. Art is not meant to be experienced in any specific way. Your take about a piece of art is always going to be different from someone else’s. I consider Seeing art in person always better, for example it makes me feel closer to the artist. Also when I am looking at a work of art, I know that what I am seeing is unique. Seeing it in person gives value to the piece. I admit that sometimes I do visit museums just because an artwork that I am going to see is really famous. But this does not mean that I can’t appreciate it or that it does not transmit me any feelings. Of course right now there are some huge advantages involving art because of the digital era. There is no need to travel or even to move to see art. It could be a real advantage for someone who is unable or does not have opportunities to visit a museum. But also I think that the fact that you only need a click to see a work of art, takes value away from the artists’ job. _________ “How Important Is Freedom of the Press?” asked students if they get news from multiple sources, and if they think doing so is important. Students wrote in from New York and New Mexico, but also from Germany and Canada. Ashutosh Tamhankar from Munich says the world needs a dissenting press: A free press is like a catalyst in a democratic society. Journalism offers a common ground for ideas to be discussed from diverse points of views and promoting a dialog.So that people can form their own opinions, values like impartiality, truth and accuracy should play a key role in the media. If the radio reports that the German government decides to swith off nuclear energy, it has to make sure the facts are right, the opinion reported is not misrepresented and that the pros and cons of this idea are presented to the audience. To support a liberal society that respects diversity, fairness and peace, we need a dissenting press. Demagogues will enjoy impunity with the lack of free press if they are successful in silencing a critical voice in the society. Miss Turkey got into trouble by writing a poem that critiqued Mr. Erdogan. Such instances will continue to happen if press is allowed to be intimidated by these “democratators”. Freedom of speech shouldn’t be misunderstood to be freedom to offend. Journalists are accountable to a pluralistic audience that trusts the press as a source of information to form their views. The press thus has a huge responsibility in keeping a healthy discourse alive to keep democracy alive. Mahir from 3DYC CLIP says news empowers others: Though it may be interesting or even entertaining, the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informed. The purpose of journalism is thus to provide citizens with the information they need to make the best possible decisions about their lives, their communities, their societies, and their governments. News is that part of communication that keeps us informed of the changing events, issues, and characters in the world outside. Though it may be interesting or even entertaining, the foremost value of news is as a utility to empower the informed. Kyla Navarro from Las Cruces, N.M., is concerned about the suppression of a free press: Since the 2016 Presidential Election, I’ve come to realize that the media is incredibly important. Journalism is a line of defense against a powerful government: it is essential to democracy to be aware of what our elected officials are doing! As someone who supports a lot of government regulation, I don’t think news outlets should be censored in any way. My peers insist on the government mitigating news outlets rather than being responsible, aware, and critical of the information they consume online or on television. Censoring the freedom of the press and free speech is also interfering with the first amendment rights of Americans: so what stops the government from stopping people to peacefully protest or worship whichever god(s) they believe in? I do agree that President Trump is a threat to the free press and I don’t think democratic leaders should denounce the media. Leaders should be aware how essential it is to the people they have sworn to serve to be aware of the good and the bad of their policies: not everyone wins in politics, people have to compromise. Marcelo from 3DYC CLIP thinks a free press is important, even though, he says, reporters can be too aggressive: I think that the freedom of press is important until a certain point, the press does not have to have the freedom to do whatever they want or to say whatever they want to say because everyone knows how harassing some reporters can be, it is true that their work is important to keep us informed about things that happened around the world. Ruth from 3DYC CLIP insists a free press should be worldwide: In my opinion, the purpose of journalism is offers enough information to all of us. It is important for all people in our country, to know more about what happen in each place. Journalism is a means of information very important. Journalists should have absolute freedom of speech everywhere in the world. Devlin Korr from Ontario, Canada highlights a case study for journalistic ethics: Soft censorship by media outlets is a serious problem that does not get enough attention. Sometimes agents of the state and/or corporate entities make it difficult for journalists to report the facts or act impartially. Consider the case of Bela Kosoian, the woman who was handcuffed and fined for not holding an escalator handrail and obstructing police in the performance of their duties. The incident was all over the news in 2009. Journalists at the time sided with the police, saying they were merely enforcing an STM by-law. Had they done their due diligence instead of acting like cheerleaders for the police, they would have discovered there is no regulation requiring commuters to hold the handrail — not then, not now. Ms. Kosoian contested her tickets in municipal court and won. News of her victory was never reported to the masses, whom to this very day live in ignorance of the injustice that was done to her — and by extension to themselves. She is currently going the route of social media with a campaign called 1becomesmany to raise awareness of her challenge to the Supreme Court of Canada on a related matter. She has a Wix blog with an entry called “Yes. Real life can be stranger than fiction”, which will give you cause to question the integrity of our so-called free press. _________ Nearly all students who responded to our Picture Prompt on cyberbullying said that it happens regularly and that social media companies should do something about it. Kayla Renee from Pennsylvania says it happens every day: Cyberbullying is a nationwide issue and ranges among all ages, not just teenagers. I have never been bullied over the internet but it’s something that most kids my age face everyday. I feel as if social media apps aren’t doing as much as they can for the children and young adults being tormented from cyberbullying. It happens too often for nothing to be changing. The most common apps where people cyberbully would be Facebook and Instagram. Facebook and Instagram can do a lot more then they are now about addressing this problem. Lexie Smith from Oxford has been a victim of cyberbullying, and thinks jokes often go too far: Students love to conceal their embarrassment or the shame of being bullied. I honestly believe that snapchat is where most of the cyber bullying take place. Most students ponder that since snap chat post disappear after 24 hours that it doesn’t matter which is false. I do feel as if social media companies should try to filter what is posted or commented. No one should feel harassed on social media, and I think that they should try to remove the negative comments and etc. For example have someone watch over pages. I think that some students are just trying to crack a joke, but takes that joke a little to far. I am aware of cyber bullying knowing the fact that at one point I was a victim of cyber bullying. I know that the act of bullying will not cease, but I think that their should be more that we can do. Dorothy Daniels from Oxford, Miss., says Instagram does a good job of removing offending posts promptly: I think Instagram is doing good recognizing and taking action when cyberbullying is spotted. To do even better, Instagram and other social media platforms should encourage users to report cyberbullying. Personally, I found that people feel intrusive or in other people’s business when they report abusive, hurtful comments. On one specific post, I saw a younger girl getting attacked for supporting a highly disliked celebrity. I reported the comments and they were removed within 24 hours. I feel like most social media is doing really well recognizing and fighting against cyberbullying. Bella from Oxford, Miss., thinks everyone deserves to be treated fairly: I think cyberbullying is a problem for some people. They feel more comfortable doing it behind a screen instead of in person. This does not happen to me, but for many other people it does. It happens on any app where you can talk to another person. People’s feelings get hurt often because others are mean to them. The people that cyberbully have probably been bullied before, so they do it to make them feel better about themselves. A person is most likely to scared to tell someone about it, so the bully takes advantage of that and does not stop. Everyone deserves to be treated fairly and no one should have to go through that! _________ Comments were wide-ranging, respectful, and thoughtful in answer to our question “How Much Do a Celebrity’s Personal Beliefs Influence Your Opinion of Their Work?,” which was inspired by Kanye West’s recent statements. Kyndall from Virginia has a strong reaction to Mr. West: My reaction to Kanye’s comments is that of disgust and disregard; I agree with the widespread denunciation. Celebrities’ personal opinions, depending on the topic, do not necessarily influence my opinion of their work, but they do influence my support of them. I’ve stopped listening to many artists because of what they’ve said and what they’ve done regardless of my initial positive feelings about their work. I don’t want to endorse a person who espouses hateful views or plain ignorance. I don’t think separating the art from the artist applies to modern public figures who should understand the significance of their comments and actions. It’s easy for people like Mr. Leibovitz to minimize Kanye’s rhetoric as a mere opinion. But while some have the privilege of ignoring politics, others are affected daily by its consequences, which is why I don’t understand how the endorsement of a man with staunch support from white supremacists should be tolerated and overlooked as simply a different viewpoint. This “free-thinking” is dangerous because it normalizes the racism Kanye has internalized and gives credibility to those who believe in these ideas. People shouldn’t be given a pass because others perceive them as creative and insightful, Kanye’s pseudo-intellectual comments, especially as a “proud non-reader of books,” are the direct opposite of insight, and they should be held accountable, especially when their “missteps” aren’t actually mistakes but intentional choices they make. Sam from Boston says part of Mr. West’s greatness is his “refusal to keep with the norm”: Kanye West has never been the kind of person to withhold what he thinks from the media because it would cause controversy. In the recent TMZ interview that he took part in, he made the comment that looking back now after hundreds of years “slavery is a choice” which immediately caused outrage. Although his comments are unpopular in the public eye, in my opinion it should not harbor an effect on the enjoyment of his musical or fashion endeavors. West has the right to say what he believes and for people to attempt to boycott his music and to cause such an uproar because of the fact that he is in the public eye. I enjoy West’s music separate from whether I agree or disagree with his political or other public views. One of the things that makes Kanye the great artist that he is, is his edge and refusal to keep with the norm. He is entitled to his opinion and in my opinion for Kanye to say something of this nature is not extremely surprising. Quin from The Governors Academy feels strongly that freedom of expression is a right for all Americans: Although I was surprised by what Kanye West said during his interview, I like hearing what celebrities have to say about topics that don’t have anything to do with their profession. You never know what they are gonna say. Kanye is a musician and an entertainer. I have never unfollowed a celebrity on social media because of their political views. If their beliefs influence their work, I would still follow them. It’s part of who they are. After listening to Kanye’s interview on TMZ, it made me realize that even though Kanye’s comments on slavery were very shocking, he has the right to express his feelings. I understand that some people were offended by what he said. He is famous and he has a lot of influence, but people have the right to criticism him, unfollow him or to boycott his products and music if they want. Freedom of expression is a right of all Americans. Kanye said in his interview that he admires Trump because he proved that anything is possible in America. I can understand how Kanye can relate to Trump as an outsider. Kanye’s interview shows how important it is to have conversations about controversial issues. Everyone has their own opinions, no matter how different they are, we should listen so that we can understand where people are coming from even if we don’t agree with them. Artists and people need to be free to express themselves, it’s one of the things that makes America great, even if we disagree with what they say. Azjan Ransome from Byfield, Mass., encourages interaction with people of varying opinions: Personally, I’m glad that Kanye West is sharing his opinion. The right to free expression is everyone’s and Kanye is not exempt. The public response was unfair; having an unpopular opinion does not make someone crazy, but, the right is entitled to their opinion as well. It’s human nature to put people in boxes. As Mr. West states in his TMZ interview, he is an artist, a musician, and a black person, but his opinions do not have to align with other members of that group. It is not his responsibility to represent anyone besides himself and his company. The most human thing that Kanye or any artist can do is express their unique perspective.A celebrities’ personal beliefs — their political leanings, philosophical stances, perspectives on the world and their causes, should not be considered when deciding the quality of their work. Simultaneously, artist’s work should not be independent of who they are. If you don’t like what someone stands for, then go find other entertainers. I would never delete a celebrities social media or not watch their performances because their opinions don’t align with mine. I believe it is important to interact with and receive the opinions of people who you don’t agree with. People’s personal beliefs have never changed my feelings about their work. I agree with Mr. Leibowitz’s statement because free expression is a right of all americans. Shania Sylvain from Apopka is personally hurt at the rapper’s comments on slavery: When people say that Kanye is in the “Sunken Place” I honestly found it as a joke but now I’m starting to think this statement is true. I feel, as many others do, that he’s only doing this because he has music coming out. Kanye is known for acting a fool when he has something coming out so that it brings him a much attention. But as far as his very surprising remarks on slavery, I am honestly extremely hurt, taken back, and disgust. Being imprisoned is not a choose. We have to keep in mind that many of those slaves made tough decisions like taking their lives and risking running away, killing masters, and rebelling. So the statement about choosing to to be slaves and being mental imprisoned was very reckless. Kyle Gaffey says no person should be treated poorly for his beliefs: After returning from his one year mental cool down, Kanye West has returned to the public eye in a very thought provoking way. Personally I believe that Mr. West’s comments could offend many people, but I can’t say I feel personally attacked by his ideals. He believes the words he is speaking and he is entitled to his opinion. The public can comment on his views but I believe that nobody should be attempting to conform him because of the influence he holds over people. Kanye West has millions of fans that will listen to what he says but people who challenge his views have no right to say he shouldn’t believe what he wants. West is challenging the social norm and he doesn’t deserve to be treated poorly based off his beliefs, no person does. Heaven from Massachusetts feels that, in the end, she cannot support an artist who offends: Just like every other person, Kanye is entitled to his own opinion, but when you’re in a position of status or power, you have to be conscious of the impact of your words. In regards to Mr. West showing his support for Trump, although I do not support Trump in any way, that is his choice and option to do so. However when stating that 400 years of slavery was a choice, there was a clear lack of thought behind what he was saying. He completely dismissed the mental and physical brutality of slavery and the repercussions of it against black people throughout history: from Jim Crow era to police brutality. I wouldn’t have had as big of a problem with it if Kanye offered an explanation, but his statement seemed as if there was little or no thought to back it up. Kanye is a great artist that many look up to, however he has to realize that what he says has an effect on everyone.In general for me, an artist’s work and beliefs go hand in hand. If something they support goes against what I stand for morally, I can not continue to support them, because at the end of the day there are plenty of artists and musicians that I can enjoy. That doesn’t mean they themselves are a bad person or their work is bad, but it would be hypocritical for me to say one thing, while supporting artists with morals that do not align with my own. Pat Flaherty from Byfield, Mass., understands the connection between Kanye and President Trump: Kanye West is notorious for speaking out against the norm and having an abstract point of view. After listening to Kanye’s interview, I was intrigued by his mindset and the way he views big political matters. Kanye was recently seen wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat and when asked about it, he replied “It was just what I was feeling that day.” He then said how he likes Trump and how he was considered an outsider in the presidential campaign and ended up becoming president. Kanye enjoyed the fact that an “outsider infiltrated” and won the election. Kanye, unlike many other rappers, likes Trump and is intrigued by the way he handles things. Kanye also likes Trump because of how he uses his platform to speak directly to the people and how the people have no fear in speaking back. Kanye believes that Trump has allowed Americans to speak out and feel comfortable doing so. _________ Students write short stories and poems in response to the Picture Prompt, “Four Items.” Brianne from New Hampshire composes a farewell poem: Goodbye May the rain splash against your umbrella May they sit like dew drops or slither away May the rain caress our cheeks? But the drops on our cheeks aren’t rain, Are they? Please let me carry your luggage for you May you find happiness above the clouds The people around us hustle along The chaos that surrounds use We reach security, I can’t go further The last time these eyes see yours The ticket stamped and I’m given one last glance A wave of a hand and a bittersweet smile You’re going to better and brighter places, Far away from me Resting on my nightstand A journal, your journal You’ve forgotten it You’d never let me read it It stays with me, daring me to explore your thoughts But I mustn’t, I can’t break your trust I can’t break what’s already broken And the drops on my cheeks aren’t rain, Are they? Danielle Filandino from Pennsylvania uses vivid details to draw readers in: At different locations on this giant green rock, there are personal items being lost. They’re carried from A to B, seeing the world from low and high, in wallets and bags. Their needs not thought about by their owners. Because they’re not living, they dont have feelings, right? Although these seem like lost items, they are just trying to go on their own journey. A book, filled with personal secrets or a schedule wants to read stories. A wet umbrella after a spring storm wants to feel the warm sun. A ticket, going somewhere far or near wants to stay put. And a suitcase, seeing hundreds of faces everyday and then being packed away, when it really wants to see the world. Maybe these items go missing on purpose, so they can be on their own. To be free of boundaries and the “stereotypes” of non living items. The ticket drifts out of a hand, the book drops out of a bag, the umbrella is left at a rest stop 30 miles up the road, and the suitcase is left alone in a florida airport. This is where their story begins. Brooke Myers from King of Prussia imagines a spy: Eggsy was going on a trip, had his luggage packed, his identifying book ready, his sword and shield umbrella, and his suitcase with his weapons, passports, and other spy stuff ready to go, all he needed was his train ticket to get to San Francisco by 9:00 and he could leave. He went to the booth, got his ticket, and left everything in his bunk room on the train to go get a drink and find out more about the train’s occupants, only to get back to find all his spy stuff, book, suitcase, and umbrella stewed all over the floor with a ripped up ticket that said, “You’re on the wrong train.” Manderine from Manhattan leaves readers in suspense: Heading out from LA for a weekend of fun with friends in San Fransisco, Jim had his necessary travel items packed in his blue carry-on rolling bag, his leather bound diary, rainbow colored umbrella for those unexpected January rain showers, toiletries and a few items he would want to wear. At 5:07 he boarded the train and took his window seat. Comfortable and relaxed, sipping on his hot take-out coffee, he looked out as the the train started to roll out of the station. With anticipation for the upcoming concert Jim took out his ticket for the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, only to see something was not right. It was the date. His ticket read: “Saturday, January 12, 2018, 8:00”. Suddenly he panicked because today was Friday January 12, 2018. Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
technology,"From the release of James Comey’s private memos about his meetings with President Trump to developing talks with North Korea, let us catch you up on six big stories from the week.  By Emily Cochrane James B. Comey’s redacted, declassified memos detailing his meetings with President Trump were released late Thursday after the Justice Department sent them to Congress. The release came hours after Mr. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, spoke with Michael Barbaro of The New York Times for an interview on the podcast “The Daily.” The memos offer an intimate look at the interactions between officials at the highest levels of government in the months leading to Mr. Comey’s ouster, elaborating on the president’s concerns about the salacious dossier detailing his supposed ties to Russia and the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser at the time.  Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at his former F.B.I. director this week as Mr. Comey continued his publicity tour across television networks to promote his tell-all memoir, “A Higher Loyalty.” Andrew G. McCabe, Mr. Comey’s former deputy director who was fired hours before retirement, also faced renewed attacks from conservatives after federal prosecutors began examining whether they had enough evidence to open a criminal investigation. A Justice Department inspector general report had repeatedly faulted Mr. McCabe for misleading investigators. Additional Reading and Listening Read the memos here.  Congressional Memo: Pressure to Release Comey Memos May Have Backfired on G.O.P. 6 Takeaways from the James Comey Memos Mr. Trump confirmed that Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and his nominee for secretary of state, visited North Korea to meet with its leader, Kim Jong-un. The goal of the trip, which took place over Easter weekend, was to lay the groundwork for a summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim.  But Mr. Trump warned on Wednesday that if he felt the diplomatic gesture was not headed toward success, he would scrap the planned summit meeting or even walk out while it was underway. Although the North has reportedly dropped its demand that the United States remove troops from South Korea as a condition for denuclearization, the Trump administration has reacted warily.  But the president reacted more favorably early Friday evening when Mr. Kim announced that North Korea no longer needed to test nuclear weapons or missiles and would close a nuclear test site.  “This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. The president, who spent part of the week meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, also rebuffed the prospect of rejoining the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a multinational trade agreement. It was another blow to Japan, which fears it has been sidelined as Mr. Trump cultivates relationships with other Asian countries.  Additional Reading Sanctions Are Hurting North Korea.

Meet Me in Mongolia: How Aging Aircraft May Dictate Kim-Trump Venue Treaty to Formally End Korean War Is Being Discussed, South Confirms The New York Times reported this week that Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, was overruled in his push to get congressional approval for a barrage of missile strikes against Syria by American, British and French forces. He succeeded, however, in limiting the strikes to three targets that did not risk endangering Russian troops at military installations scattered through Syria.  But a military intelligence report found that while the strikes probably stalled the production of sarin gas, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is expected to continue researching and developing chemical weapons.  There was also a public divide over whether the administration would impose a fresh round of sanctions against Russian companies found to be aiding Syria’s chemical weapons program. Mr. Trump rejected the measure after his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, said on a Sunday television program that the administration would be enforcing them.  Ms. Haley pushed back against the idea that there had been “momentary confusion” over the issue, as Larry Kudlow, the president’s top economic adviser had suggested.  “With all due respect, I don’t get confused,” she said.

Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, will join Mr. Trump’s legal team in an attempt to “quickly” resolve the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and ties to Trump campaign associates.  A federal judge in Manhattan indicated on Monday that she was not prepared to grant Mr. Trump exclusive first access to the documents that F.B.I. agents had seized in raids on the office and hotel room of his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. In the courtroom, it was also revealed that Sean Hannity, the Fox News commentator, was another client of Mr. Cohen.  Mr. Cohen has been treated poorly by Mr. Trump over the course of their relationship, with gratuitous insults, dismissive statements and, at least twice, threats of being fired. There is now concern about that treatment backfiring if Mr. Cohen ends up cooperating with federal officials.  Mr. Trump’s campaign also faced a new legal entanglement on Friday after the Democratic National Committee named the campaign in a sweeping lawsuit filed in federal court. The committee says it was the victim of a conspiracy by Russian officials, the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign.

Mr. Pompeo, the current C.I.A. director, is expected to be confirmed as the country’s 70th secretary of state. However, he is also expected to receive a historic rebuke from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is not likely to recommend his confirmation.  The C.I.A. is mounting an unusual campaign to ensure that its deputy director, Gina Haspel, a career spy with a highly classified career, succeeds Mr. Pompeo as the agency’s director. Ms. Haspel faces opposition from Democrats, who are likely to have questions about her role in overseeing the brutal interrogation of a terrorism suspect at a secret prison in Thailand and conveying orders to destroy videos that documented torture. The nominee to lead NASA, Jim Bridenstine, was confirmed on Thursday in a stark partisan vote, ending the longest span of time that the agency has gone without a leader. The vote, which lasted more than 45 minutes, was punctuated by the arrival of Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois. She cast her “no” vote with her infant daughter cuddled in her lap — a first for the Senate.  Additional Reading G.O.P.

technology,"By Jonah Engel Bromwich A spokesman for United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement has resigned, saying that he could no longer “bear the burden” of spreading falsehoods on behalf of the Trump administration. The spokesman, James Schwab, who had worked for the agency’s San Francisco Division, told news outlets Monday that his decision was prompted by false statements made by the agency on Feb. 27 and repeated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last week. The statements criticized the mayor of Oakland, Libby Schaaf, for her decision last month to warn city residents that a raid by federal immigration agents targeting roughly 1,000 people was imminent. The agency’s deputy director, Thomas D. Homan, said that Ms. Schaaf’s warning had helped “864 criminal aliens and public safety threats” to evade capture in the raid. Mr. Sessions, in a visit to California last week, condemned Ms. Schaaf, a Democrat, and echoed the agency, asserting that her actions had allowed hundreds to escape. Mr. Schwab said in interviews, first with The San Francisco Chronicle and then with CNN, that he had been frustrated by the remarks, and had quit “because I didn’t want to perpetuate misleading facts.” “I asked them to change the information,” he told The Chronicle, referring to the 864 people to whom the statement alluded. “I told them that the information was wrong, they asked me to deflect, and I didn’t agree with that. Then I took some time and I quit.” He explained that the enforcement agency would have been unlikely to capture all of the roughly 1,000 undocumented immigrants in the area that it had targeted, and that it was incorrect to identify those who were not detained as threats to public safety. “We were never going to pick up that many people,” he said. “To say that 100 percent are dangerous criminals on the street, or that those people weren’t picked up because of the misguided actions of the mayor, is just wrong.” Mr. Schwab did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. He resigned last week, according to CNN. “I just couldn’t bear the burden — continuing on as a representative of the agency and charged with upholding integrity, knowing that information was false,” he told CNN, adding that in his 16 years of experience in government he had never been asked to deflect when he knew something was inaccurate. In a statement, Ms. Schaaf, whom President Trump criticized last week for alerting residents to the raid, praised Mr. Schwab “for speaking the truth while under intense pressure to lie.” “Our democracy depends on public servants who act with integrity and hold transparency in the highest regard,” she added. An official at the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, briefed on the plans for the raid said last month that agents find only about 30 percent of their targets on average during large sweeps. Mr. Schwab told CNN that he thought Ms. Schaaf’s actions were “misguided,” but that blaming her “for 800 dangerous people out there is just false.” ICE responded to Mr. Schwab’s comments in a statement, saying, “Even one criminal alien on the street can put public safety at risk.” “As Director Homan stated, while we can’t put a number on how many targets avoided arrest due to the mayor’s warning, it clearly had an impact,” the statement said. “While we disagree with Mr. Schwab on this issue, we appreciate his service and wish him well.” “If anyone wants to have a public argument over precisely how many dangerous criminal aliens eluded arrest because of the mayor’s irresponsible actions, we are happy to have that debate,” Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said in a statement. In a 2016 interview, Mr. Schwab told The Marion Press, his hometown paper in Michigan, that he joined the Army after high school and was deployed to Korea for four years. His service lasted until 2005, according to his LinkedIn page, and he later joined the Department of Defense, where he became a public affairs specialist in 2011. He also worked at NASA for several years before joining ICE. Follow Jonah Bromwich on Twitter: @Jonesieman. Katie Benner contributed reporting.    Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS "
technology,"By Karen Zraick and Sandra Stevenson (Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The poet Sylvia Plath. The photographer Diane Arbus, above. Ida B. Wells, the anti-lynching activist. These extraordinary women, and so many others, did not get New York Times obituaries. Until now. On International Women’s Day, we introduced a new series, “Overlooked.” We begin with obituaries for 15 women, and it will become a weekly feature. Our editor discussed how the idea came to her, and another explained why most obituaries we publish are still of white men. Do you have a suggestion for an “Overlooked” obit? ____ 2. President Trump signed off on tough tariffs on steel and aluminum, defying opposition within his own party and protests from overseas. He exempted Canada and Mexico, and held out the possibility of later exempting other allies, such as Australia. Later on Thursday, Mr. Trump accepted an invitation from North Korea’s leader to meet for nuclear negotiations. It’s a breathtaking gamble. ____ 3. Barack and Michelle Obama, Netflix stars? Insiders tell us that the former president and first lady are in advanced negotiations with the streaming service to produce a series that would provide them with a global platform. In one possible show idea, Mr. Obama would discuss or moderate conversations on topics that dominated his presidency, like health care, voting rights, immigration, foreign policy and climate change. ____ 4. In California, businesses and local law enforcement agencies are caught in the middle of a fight over immigration. The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit seeking to nullify state laws that protect undocumented immigrants, as part of a larger crackdown. We talked to the head of an agricultural company in the Central Valley who complied with a federal audit of his payroll records. He also posted a notice about it for his workers, as required by state law. Many quit immediately. “I am a pawn caught between the federal and state governments, like a child between two fighting parents,” he said. “Each is threatening to punish me if I don’t listen.” ____ 5. Clocks spring forward one hour on Sunday, and not everyone is happy about the ritual. Often, complaints take the form of calls to eliminate daylight saving time altogether. But Florida wants to move in the opposite direction. The State Senate has passed a bill that would make daylight saving time the year-round standard. Above, sunset in Tallahassee. There’s just one catch: federal law prohibits that. States can opt out of daylight saving time — Arizona and Hawaii do — but states are not allowed to exempt themselves from standard time. ____ 6. China is all but certain to throw out a rule that restricts presidents to two five-year terms at the National People’s Congress this weekend. The beneficiary, President Xi Jinping, could be in power for life. Despite the display of support, murmurings of opposition suggest that Mr. Xi and his subordinates have not fully sold the idea to a broader public — or done much to explain it. Stirrings of internal discontent could build over time, our Beijing correspondents write. Here’s a look at Mr. Xi and his rise to power. ____ 7. In our latest visual investigation, we show how villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been destroyed in recent attacks, forcing 140,000 people to flee. This Times Insider piece explains how we used active-fire data from NASA and Openstreetmap to bring the atrocities to light. ____ 8. Madison, in southeastern Indiana, is a picturesque small town battling life-or-death problems. Residents struggle with drug addiction and mental health issues, as well as child abuse and neglect. The suicide rate is 3.2 times the national figure. Our reporter spent time with a high school football team that provides much-needed support to its young players. “I’d rather focus on the kids than the wins,” said the coach, above left. “Because I see what can happen to kids who stray.” ____ 9. We talked to Adam Rippon, the outspoken 28-year-old figure skater who won a bronze medal at the Winter Olympics, about what he’s learned and where he’s going. He’s the first openly gay American man to qualify to compete in the Winter Games, and he criticized Vice President Mike Pence, who attended the Games, for his opposition to gay rights. Mr. Rippon also spoke out about body image and unhealthy dieting in the sport. “In skating you have four minutes to show the world what you’ve been working on your entire life,” he said. “If you can’t embrace who you are, how are you going to show a panel of judges or the world who you are in four minutes?” ____ 10. Finally, the late-night hosts weighed in on a lawsuit filed by the pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with President Trump. Seth Meyers joked that he was surprised Mr. Trump didn’t hold a signing ceremony for a nondisclosure agreement. Here’s what else is on TV and streaming services Thursday. And we offer our recipe of the day: flourless cocoa cookies. They’re gluten-free, and you can whip them up in just 20 minutes.

technology,"The former F.B.I. director was interviewed for “The Daily” podcast. Here are five takeaways from the conversation. James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.CreditDamon Winter/The New York Times Supported by By Michael Barbaro Listen and subscribe to our podcast from your mobile device: Via Apple Podcasts | Via RadioPublic | Via Stitcher James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, spoke with me for Friday’s episode of “The Daily,” as he wraps up a publicity tour for his book, “A Higher Loyalty.” Our conversation focused on his decision, before his firing, to document his interactions with President Trump in a series of memos — and to eventually share the contents of one of those memos with a journalist, in the hopes of pressuring the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel in the Russia investigation.  Here are five takeaways from the interview. I started the interview where Mr. Comey begins his book — actually before he begins his book, in the author’s note, with a strikingly candid observation about his own personality. “All people have flaws and I have many,” he wrote. “Some of mine, as you’ll discover in this book, are that I can be stubborn, prideful, overconfident and driven by ego.”  It seemed like his decision to itemize his own shortcomings before recounting his role in the investigation of Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump over the past two years might be an acknowledgment that those flaws help explain his conduct. But Mr. Comey quickly rejected the idea that his ego had played a role in how he managed the investigation into Mr. Trump.  He conceded, instead, that it might have influenced how he treated the inquiry into Mrs. Clinton’s private email server — in particular his unusual news conference, in July 2016, condemning how she had handled classified government emails as “extremely careless.”  It was his own children, he said, who had told him that the news conference was flawed, because he dwelled for so long on Mrs. Clinton’s misdeeds, before finally — and suspensefully — announcing he would not charge her with any crime. They called that delayed delivery of the most important information “Seacresting.”  In their mind, he had acted like Ryan Seacrest, as host of “American Idol,” seemingly prepared to announce a singer’s elimination or victory, but first taking a long, unwanted commercial break. “I think that criticism is actually valid,” he told me. “The reason I associate it with ego is I think I thought I knew the right way to do it and in hindsight,” he said, “I don’t think I did.” [Read a transcript of the interview from the episode.] Mr. Comey said his ritual of writing memos about conversations with Mr. Trump began after a meeting inside Trump Tower on Jan. 6, 2017 — but not because Mr. Trump, then president-elect, had said something especially alarming. Instead, Mr. Comey said, from the very first moments of their relationship, he believed Mr. Trump could not be trusted.  “I knew I was communicating with someone who might not tell the truth about it if it ever became an issue,” Mr. Comey said. From that point on, Mr. Comey decided to document his one-on-one interactions with the new president in case there was ever any question about what had transpired during such sessions.  “Normally I wasn’t even much of a note taker,” he said. “But here I thought given those factors that I would need a detailed account in the event I need to draw on it in the future.” Which, of course, is exactly what happened.  I asked Mr. Comey why, after his firing in May 2017, he had deliberately shared the contents of one of his memos with a reporter, in the hopes of producing news coverage that would alarm the public about Mr. Trump’s conduct and therefore prompt the appointment of a special counsel.  Why did he decide to work outside the justice system, rather than within it? His reply was blunt: He did not trust the leaders of the Justice Department, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, to effectively and fairly carry out such an investigation themselves.  In his mind, Mr. Sessions would soon be recused from the Russia investigation, rendering him ineffectual, and Mr. Rosenstein had shown himself to be untrustworthy because of his role in firing Mr. Comey.  It was Mr. Rosenstein who had written a memo to the president laying out the reasons Mr. Comey should be fired. “I did not have confidence that it would be done in the right way,” Mr. Comey said.  “My plan was to stay,” Mr. Comey told me, when I asked if he wished he were still the director of the F.B.I. He might have eventually been fired over a different clash with Mr. Trump, he said. But as attacks on the F.B.I. have mounted, including from the president, Mr. Comey said, his desire to protect the agency has grown.  These days, he said, he tries to read about 20 pieces of mail a day from current and former F.B.I. agents, who write to him about their experience.  “I could only read them about 20 at a time before I got a pain in my chest from their sadness and my sadness of not being with them,” he said. “Reading about their grief, which reflects my grief, is the hardest part.” During his book tour, Mr. Comey has described Mr. Trump as morally unfit for the office of the presidency — a profoundly damning judgment from a former director of the F.B.I. I wondered whether Mr. Comey feared that his comments risked further politicizing the bureau at a time when it is the subject of intense scrutiny.  “I worry a little bit,” he said. But his goal, he said, is to prompt a conversation that will ultimately benefit the F.B.I. and the country.  I asked what, exactly, that conversation is. “Most broadly,” he said, “I’d like to have a conversation about what are the values at the core of this country and about our expectations that our leaders reflect those values? And encourage people to rise above their partisan passions, their policy passions and realize that without that collection of values and without leaders who are tethered to those values and held accountable by us to those values, we’re lost.”  If you don’t see an audio player on this page or to subscribe to The Daily for free, follow the instructions below.
